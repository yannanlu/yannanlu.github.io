<p>
ServerPersister is a JMS message consumer that listens to a ServerSocket and
accepts socket connections from it.  Once there is a new connection, it checks
out a thread to handle the message I/O on the socket. The thread keeps
getting JMS messages from the input XQueue and writes their content
to the socket.  Currently, it supports two operations, provide and publish.
In case of the provide operation, ServerPersister allows multiple client
threads to pick up messages from the same XQueue.  ServerPersister supports
flow control and allows object control from its owner.  It is fault tolerant
with retry and idle options.  In case of the publish operation, however,
ServerPersister allows multiple subscribers to pick up messages published
from the same XQueue and each client gets its own copies.  In this case,
there is no flow control and buffer overrun may occur.  Therefore,
ServerPersister is a JMS message outlet, or a JMS message provider.
The max number of client connections is determined by both Capacity and
Partition of the XQueue.  Backlog is the queue length of the server socket
listener.
