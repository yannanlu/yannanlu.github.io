ScreenNode is a filter node that applies the screen operation on JMS messages
according to their content and the predefined rulesets.  Based on the filter,
all the messages will be routed into four outlinks: done for the messages
passing through the screening process, nohit for those messages do not belong
to any predefined rulesets, failure for the messages failed at the screening
process and bypass for the messages screened out.  Since ScreenNode does not
consume any messages, any incoming messages has to find a way out via one
of the four outlinks.

<p>
ScreenNode contains a number of pre-defined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each ruleset
defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also defines the screening
options for the messages in each group as well as other parameters used
in the screening process, such as TimeToLive and XAMode. With different
screen options, ScreenNode withholds messages until their sessions time
out. Therefore, each group maintains its own cache and the session to
withhold messages temporarily. KeyTemplate is used to extract the keys
from of the messages. These keys will be used to track the withheld
messages in the cache. TimeToLive determines when to time out the session
for the cache. Further more, ScreenNode always creates one extra ruleset,
nohit. The ruleset of nohit is for all the messages not hitting any of
the patterns.
</p>
<p>
ScreenNode will not consume any messages. But it may remove the withheld
messages from the uplink for certain rulesets. If EXTERNAL_XA bit is set
on the uplink, those removed messages will be acknowledged as well.
Eventually, those removed and withheld messages will continue to propagate
downstreams as usual. This feature is controlled by XAMode of the ruleset.
If XAMode is not defined in a ruleset, the ruleset will inherit it from
the node, which will be 1 by default. If it is set to 0, all the withheld
messages for the ruleset will be acknowledged and removed from the uplink.
There is a big consequence to disable XA on a ruleset. Please be extremely
careful if you wnat to disable XA on any ruleset.
</p>
<p>
Here are considerations on when to disable XA on a ruleset. First, you may
want ScreenNode to withhold more messages than the capacity of the uplink.
Second, the source JMS servers may not be able to handle large amount of
unacknowledged messages. In these cases, XAMode of certain rulesets may be
set to zero explicitly to disable the XA. As you know, most of the JMS
vendors implement message acknowledgement via sessions. The acknowledgement
by ScreenNode may upset the XA control of the message flow.
</p>
<p>
ScreenNode is also able to monitor the load level report of its first
outlink if the report is defined.  If the load is high, all cache sessions
on will be frozen.  It means ScreenNode will ignore all TTLs and will
treat all cache sessions without expirations.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But ScreenNode
always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for bypass, the third for
failure and the last for nohit.  Any two or more outlinks can share the same
outlink name.  It means these outlinks are sharing the same output channel.

<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for ScreenNode.

</TR>
</TABLE>
where SessionSize defines the max number of cached messages in the session.
Heartbeat controls how often to check the session state. If StringProperty is
defined on the node level, it will be used to build the summary for those
withheld messages for display.

<p>
The screen operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of ScreenNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for ScreenNode.

</TABLE>
where ScreenOption only supports min, max, first, last, first_last, and none.
Within the same session, if ScreenOption is first, only the first the message
will propagate to out.  The rest of the messages with the same key will be
routed to bypas.  If ScreenOption is first_last, the first and the last
messages with the same key will be routed to out with in the same session.
The rest will go to bypass.  PreferredOutLink can only be defined for bypass
rulesets.  In this case, the messages of the group will not be processed.
Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of BYPASS without processing them.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the screen ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "max_job",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "messageType": "8"
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "300",
    "FieldName": "count",
    "DataType": "integer",
    "ScreenOption": "max",
    "KeyTemplate": "##site##/##hostname##"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where the rule only routes the messages with max count to out.  The session
is 5 min.
