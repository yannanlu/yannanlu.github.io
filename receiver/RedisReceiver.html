<p>
RedisReceiver is a JMS message producer that block-pops items from a given
Redis list or subscribes messages from a given Redis channel. It puts the
content to JMS messages.  Those messages will be sent to an XQueue as the
output. RedisReceiver supports flow control and allows object control from
its owner.  It is fault tolerant with retry and idle options.

<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for RedisReceiver.
