<p>
PickupNode listens to an input XQ for JMS messages with an arbitrary URI
as a request to retrieve messages. For each incoming message, the URI
identifies the data source. PickupNode looks it up in the local cache for
any XQueue as the transmit queue established for the data source. If there is
an XQueue in the cache for the data source, PickupNode just packs up all the
messages in the XQueue into the incoming message body and sends it back as
the response. Otherwise, PickupNode will generate a new request with the
URI and a newly created XQueue for the data source. The request will be sent
to the outlink connected to a ReceiverPool for a new receiver thread.  Once
the receiver is instantiated, PickupNode will collect the response from the
ReceiverPool.  The response is supposed to contain the receiver thread for
receiving the messages from the specific data source. PickupNode caches the
thread and the id of the XQueue with the URI as the key.  Therefore, PickupNode
is able to receive JMS messages via the receivers from arbitrary data sources
based on their URIs and the predefined rulesets on-demand.  The received
messages will be cached in their XQueues for picking up until they expires.

<p>
PickupNode has two types of outlinks, position-fixed and non-fixed.
There are three position-fixed outlinks: pool for all requests to the
ReceiverPool, failure for the messages failed in the request process,
nohit for those messages not covered by any rulesets.  The non-fixed
outlinks are transmit queues for the on-demand data sources.
</p>
<p>
PickupNode also contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These
rulesets categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore,
each rule defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also specifies
the way to construct URI and properties for the new receivers.  For those
messages falling off all defined rulesets, PickupNode always creates
an extra ruleset, nohit, to handle them.  Therefore all the nohit messages
will be routed to nohit outlink.  The downstream node at nohit is supposed
to handle all nohit messages.
</p>
<p>
URI is used to identify the data source.  In order to construct the URI
for an arbitrary data source, each ruleset contains two sets of
format operations.  The first one is the list of templates with the name
of URITemplate.  The other is the list of substitutions with the name of
URISubstitution.  URITemplate appends the previous non-empty text to URI
and sets the next initial text for its corresponding URISubstitutions to
modify.  The associations between the URITemplates and URISubstitutions are
based on their positions.  Either URITemplate or URISubstitution can be
null for no action and a place holder.  Therefore, you can insert multiple
null URITemplates so that the associated URISubstitutions will be able to
modify the same text in turns.  If any of the operations fails, the message
will be routed to failure outlink.  Besides, a ruleset may contain a map
of DefaultProperty as static or dynamic properties for the new receivers.
If the URI string is not in the cache, PickupNode will try to resolve all
the dynamic variables in the map of DefaultProperty from the incoming message
first. Then it adds the DefaultProperty to the new request for the new receiver.
So the extra properties are able to passed over to the receiver pool.
</p>
<p>
For each new data source, PickupNode creates an Object message as
the request containing the URI and the XQueue, as well as the default
properties provided they are defined.  The request is sent to the
ReceiverPool via the pool outlink.  Then PickupNode frequently checks the
response for each outstanding requests.  The response is supposed to have
the status and the receiver thread for the new data source. PickupNode
will use the thread to monitor its status.  If the response does not have
the thread, PickupNode will route the messages to the failure outlink and
remove the XQueue and the URI from the cache. The samething will happen if
the request for a new receiver times out.  MaxRetry is used to control
when to timeout the request to the pool.  It also controls the timeout on
a dead receiver thread.
</p>
<p>
PickupNode also maintains an active set of XQueues as the receiving queues
for all data sources.  In front of each XQueue, there is at least one
receiver thread receiving the messages from the data source.  The
messages are available for applications to pick up.  If PickupNode has not
got any pickup requests for certain queues, it will mark them idle, no
matter how many messages available.  All dynamic queues are monitored
frequently in every heartbeat.  If one of them has been idle for over
MaxIdleTime, the queue will be stopped.  Its receiver thread and the queue
as well as the leftover messages will also be removed from cache.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks.  But
PickupNode always assumes the first outlink for pool, the second for failure
and the third for nohit.  The name for nohit is allowed to be overlapped with
that of failure.  But neither nohit nor failure is allowed to share their names
with pool.  The rest of the outlinks are for the on-demand data sources.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are four implementation specific
properties for PickupNode.

The pickup operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of PickupNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for PickupNode.
