<p>
MonitorNode is a monitor container hosting dynamic monitor instances.
It listens to an input XQueue for JMS messages as requests to monitor certain
occurrences.  If the message contains a request for a new monitor, it will
create the monitor instance according to the ruleset and the content.  Upon
success, the incoming message will be routed to the outlink of bypass. If it
fails to create the object, the message will be routed to the outlink of
failure.  If there is no ruleset to handle the message, it will be routed to
the outlink of nohit.  Meanwhile, MonitorNode periodically sends all active
monitor instances as tasks to the outlink of pool. On the other end of the
outlink, a number of MonitorPersisters will be listening on the outlink for
tasks. They will run each monitor tasks and updates the results for the tasks.
Each task will be collected for evaluations on its result. MonitorNode will
apply the predefined EventPattern on the ruleset to chech the result.  If the
result is as expected,  MonitorNode will generate a new message and routes it
to the outlink of done.  Then the monitor will be terminated and the monitor
instance will be destroyed.

<p>
MonitorNode also contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These
rulesets categorize messages into non-overlapping groups via the filters.
Therefore, each rule defines a unique message group.  If a ruleset is not
of bypass, it is supposed to define a template to construct properties for
new monitor instances.  It also contains multiple parameters for the node to
manage active monitor instances. For example, TimeToLive specifies the lifetime
in seconds of the new monitor instance. Once the instance passes that time span,
MonitorNode will escalate the final event and terminates the instance. Option is
another parameter which controls when to deliver the original request.  By
default, it is zero and there is no wait on the final event.  If it is 1,
MonitorNode will hold the request and waits until the final event is
escalated.  Heartbeat determines how often to run the monitor instance.  The
non-bypass rulesets may also have a list of EventPatterns to determine when
to escalate the final event for the occurrence and to terminate the request.
The total number of active occurrences is stored into the RULE_PEND field.
For those messages falling off all defined rulesets, MonitorNode always
creates an extra ruleset, nohit, to handle them.  Therefore all the nohit
messages will be routed to the outlink of nohit.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the five fixed outlinks.  But
MonitorNode always assumes the first outlink for pool, the second for done,
the third for bypass, the fourth for failure and the last for nohit.

Apart from the common properties, there are two implementation specific
properties for MonitorNode.

where Heartbeat determines how frequently to run those monitors. If
StringProperty is defined on the node level, it will be used to build the
summary on cached messages for display.

<p>
The monitor operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of MonitorNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for MonitorNode.

where Monitor is the configuration template for monitor instances with
certain variables.  The node will resolve those variables based on the data
extracted from the request message.  You can find many examples on
MonitorAgent page.

where there are two rulesets with different hearteats.  Frequently, the node
dispatches the active monitors to the pool.  Then it tries to collect the
events sent from the monitors.  If an event match the EventPattern, the monitor
will be terminated and a new event will be escalated.
