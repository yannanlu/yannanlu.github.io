<p>
PipeNode is a message node that controls the throughput of the message flow.
PipeNode picks up JMS messages from the input XQueue. By default, the cache is
enabled. So PipeNode caches the incoming messages first.  Then it dispatches
them based on the priorities and thresholds for each of groups.  There is only
one outlink, pipe.  All the groups share the same pipe with different
priorities and thresholds.

<p>
PipeNode contains multiple rulesets that categorize the incoming messages
into non-overlapped groups. Each group has its own priority for scheduling
and threshold as the maximum number of active messages waiting for feedback.
PipeNode also supports the dynamic threshold via the list of ActiveTime.
By default, every message in the same group is unique. But if KeyTemplate
is defined in the ruleset, messages with the same key are treated as
identical. PipeNode will make sure only the first one of the identical
messages will be scheduled. This way, PipeNode is able to control flow
throughput on each group of messages.  On the node level, DisplayMask and
StringProperty control the display result of outgoing messages. StringProperty
is also used to build the summary on each cached messages for display.
</p>
<p>
By default, PipeNode has the cache enabled.  So all the overflown messages
will be cached. Due to the scheduling process, the message affinity may
get broken. However, if the cache is disabled, the message affinity will
be guaranteed. In this case, the first overflown message will block until
the required resource is available.
</p>
<p>
PipeNode always creates an extra ruleset, nohit, for those messages not
hitting any pre-defined rulesets.  It is always the first ruleset with the
id of 0.  For nohit, there is no flow control by default. It means that
there is no caching and no scheduling either. However, if nohit is the only
ruleset, and a nonzero Throughput is defined, and the cache is disabled as
well, the thoughput of the nohit messages will be controlled not to exceed
the pre-defined Throughput in a session. The duration of a session is defined
via Heartbeat in second. Throughput is the number of the messages allowed
to propagate within a session. The total number of propagated messages in
the previous session is saved into RULE_PEND for nohit ruleset. Therefore,
PipeNode can also be inserted into a message flow to monitor its throughput.

<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are two implementation specific
properties for PipeNode.
<TABLE border=1>

</TR>
</TABLE>
where a positive Throughput works if and only if CacheEnabled is false and
there is no pre-defined ruleset.

<p>
The flow control operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of PipeNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for PipeNode.

Here is an example of the ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "proxy",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "AssetID": "^\\d+$",
      "Type": "^8$"
    }],
    "Priority": "250",
    "Threshold": "24",
    "KeyTemplate": "##AssetID##"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it has threshold of 24 for all days.  It means only 24 messages of this
group can be outstanding in the queue.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of PipeNode:
<pre>

        "Threshold": "8"
      }]
    }]
  }],
  "OutLink": ["pipe"]
}
</pre>
where there are two rulesets.  The second rule defines the different thresholds
based on the week days and weekends.
