<p>
DeliverNode listens to an input XQ for JMS messages with an arbitray URI
as their destinations.  For each incoming message, DeliverNode looks up
its URI in the local cache for any XQueue as the transmit queue established
for the destination. If there is an XQueue in the cache for the destination,
DeliverNode just puts the incoming message to the XQueue as the delivery.
Otherwise, DeliverNode will generate a request with the URI and a newly
created XQueue for the destination. The request will be sent to the outlink
connected to a PersisterPool for a new persister thread. Once the persister
is instantiated, DeliverNode will collect the response from the
PersisterPool.  The response is supposed to contain the persister thread
for delivering the messages to the specific destination.  DeliverNode
caches the thread and the id of the XQueue using the URI as the key.
Therefore, DeliverNode is able to deliver JMS messages to arbitrary
destinations based to their URIs and the predefined rulesets on-demand.

<p>
It has two types of outlinks, position-fixed and non-fixed.
There are three position-fixed outlinks: pool for all requests to the
PersisterPool, failure for the messages failed in the delivery process,
nohit for those messages not covered by any rulesets.  The non-fixed
outlinks are tranmit queues for the on-demand destinations.
</p>
<p>
DeliverNode also contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These
rulesets categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore,
each rule defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also specifies
the way to construct URI and properties for the new Persisters.  For those
messages falling off all defined rulesets, DeliverNode always creates
an extra ruleset, nohit, to handle them.  Therefore all the nohit messages
will be routed to nohit outlink.  The downstream node at nohit is supposed
to handle all nohit messages.
</p>
<p>
URI is used to identify destinations.  In order to construct the URI for an
arbitrary destination, each ruleset contains two sets of format operations.
The first one is the list of templates with the name of URITemplate.
The other is the list of substitutions with the name of URISubstitution.
URITemplate appends the previous non-empty text to URI and sets the next
initial text for its corresponding URISubstitutions to modify.
The associations between the URITemplates and URISubstitutions are based on
their positions.  Either URITemplate or URISubstitution can be null for
no action and a place holder.  Therefore, you can insert multiple null
URITemplates so that the associated URISubstitutions will be able to modify
the same text in turns.  If any of the operations fails, the message will
be routed to failure outlink.  Besides the URI, a ruleset may contain
the default propertes under DefaultProperty for the new destination.
</p>
<p>
For each new destination, DeliverNode creates an Object message as the
request containing the URI and the XQueue, as well as the default
properties provided they are defined.  The request is sent to the
PersisterPool via the pool outlink.  Then DeliverNode frequently checks the
response for each outstanding requests.  The response is supposed to have
the status and the persister thread for the new destination.  DeliverNode
will use the thread to monitor its status.  If the response does not have
the thread, DeliverNode will route the messages to the failure outlink and
remove the XQueue and the URI from the cache. The samething will happen if
the request for a new persister times out.  MaxRetry is used to control
when to timeout the request to the pool.  It also controls the timeout on
a dead persister thread.
</p>
<p>
DeliverNode also maintains an active set of XQueues as the transmit queues
for all destinations.  Behind each XQueue, there is at least one persister
thread delivering the messages to the destinations.  The messages may be
stuck in the XQueue until they are delivered, as long as the persister is
not stopped.  However, if there is no message in the queue, DeliverNode
will mark it idle.  All the transmit queues are monitored frequently in
every heartbeat.  If one of them has been idle for over MaxIdleTime, its
queue will be stopped. Its persister thread and the transmit queue will be
removed from the cache.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks.  But
DeliverNode always assumes the first outlink for pool, the second for failure
and the third for nohit.  The name for nohit is allowed to be overlapped with
that of failure.  But neither nohit nor failure is allowed to share their
names with the pool.  The rest of the outlinks are for on-demand destinations.

Apart from the common properties, there are three implementation specific
properties for DeliverNode.

The delivery operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of DeliverNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for DeliverNode.
