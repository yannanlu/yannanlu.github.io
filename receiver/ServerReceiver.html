<p>
ServerReceiver is a JMS message producer that listens to a ServerSocket and
accepts socket connections from it.  Once there is a new connection, it checks
out a thread to handle the message I/O on the socket.  The thread reads the
byte stream, adds them into messages and puts the messages to the output XQueue.
ServerReceiver supports flow control and allows object control from its owner.
It is fault tolerant with retry and idle options.  The max number of client
connections is determined by both Capacity and Partition of the XQueue.
Backlog is the queue length of the server socket listener.
</p>
<p>
ServerReceiver supports the operations of respond and acquire.  For the 
operation of respond, ServerReceiver is paired with the client in operation of
request. In this case, ServerReceiver receives the message as the request.
Then it fulfills the request and sends the response back.  For the operation of
acquire, ServerReceiver is reading the bytes and adds the content to the
outgoing messages.

Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for ServerReceiver.

Here is an example of ServerReceiver:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_admin",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.ServerReceiver",
  "URI": "tcp://localhost:6627",
  "LinkName": "escalation",
  "Operation": "respond",
  "Capacity": "64",
  "Partition": "0,32",
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "EOTBytes": "0x0a",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Template": "##body##\n",
  "Parser": {
    "ClassName": "org.qbroker.event.EventParser"
  }
}
</pre>
where it accepts the TCP connections at the port of 6627.  The request will
ended with the newline.  The response will be parsed by the EventParser.
