EventSubscription and its Configurations 
</B>
</FONT>
</CENTER>
<p>
EventFlow is a centralized Event pub/sub service. The end users can subscribe
events based on their interests on the event content. Once there is an
incoming event htting a subscription, EventFlow will invoke the actions
associated with the subscription and delivers the event to the customers
in thier customized format.
</p>
<p>
EventSubscription is an object of ConfigList that represents a list of
configurations of three types of rulesets, Subscriptions for EventDispatcher,
Correlations for EventCorrlator and Escalations for EventMonitor. It has the
short name of <b>Sub</b>. On WebAdmin, Sub may have multiple services.
Each of the service will have one PropertyMonitor as the hook in the workflow
of EventFlow. For example, devteam is a service of <b>Sub</b>. It is
corresponding to the ruleset of the same name in node_dispatcher. Each service
has its own master configuration file, <b>Sub.json</b>, which lists all the
names of the items. The detail of an item is defined in a separate file.
Here is an example of the master configuration file, <b>Sub.json</b>:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "Sub",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.monitor.ConfigList",
  "Site": "SPORT",
  "Type": "ConfigList",
  "Category": "EVENT",
  "Discription": "It lists all subscripions for DEV",
  "Subscription": ["mail_dev"],
  "Correlation": ["all_dev"],
  "Escalation": ["for_dev"]
}
</pre>
<p>
This example lists 3 rulesets. The first one is mail_dev, a subscription,
which will be added to node_dispatcher. The second one is all_dev,
a correlation, which will be added to node_correlation. The third is for_dev,
an escalation, which will be added to node_monitor. As the end users, you can
add new subcriptions, remove the old ones or modify the existing ones.
Once the change is made, just make sure to publish all the changes first.
Then publish the master configuration file also, no matter if it has been
changed or not. 
</p>

<a NAME="Event"></a>
<H3> Event </H3>
<p>
In order to understand EventFlow's Pub/Sub services, you need to get
familiar with Event.  An Event is a self-described structure message,
similar to a JSON message.  It has some mandatory properties or attributes,
such as priority, name, site, type, text, etc.  It also has other free-formed
properties.  All the properties are of Java String type.  The applications use
Event to exchange information and data.  The benefit of Event is to allow
applications on different platforms to easily parse, match, evaluate, correlate
and process the messages.
</p>

<p>
Here lists the mandatory properties of an Event:
<TABLE border=1>
<TR>
<TH> Property Name </TH> <TH> Requirement </TH> <TH> Description </TH> <TH> Examples </TH>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<p>
Since Event has multiple properties, the applications can put anything inside
an Event.  With EventFlow, customers can subscribe those events
that match to certain patterns.  EventFlow supports most of Perl5
regular expressions.  All the properties of Event are allowed to be evaluated
against regular expressions.  For example, a user can subscribe all events
from the machine of <TT>panda</TT>.  You just need to create an EventPattern
with only one match entry on the hostname property of Event.  If the same user
is interested in the CRIT events of category <TT>WMQ</TT> only after the work.
You just need to add two entries on category and priority to the rule, and
specify the active timewindow for the subscription. As long as the subscription
is well defined, EventFlow will deliver the events to the user in a 
customized format. Therefore, EventFlow is a broker that dispatches
events to their subscribers.
</p>
<p>
Here is the example of EventPattern and active timewindows we have just
mentioned above:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "EventPattern": [{
    "priority": "^CRIT$",
    "hostname": "^panda$",
    "category": "^WMQ$"
  }],
  "ActiveTime": {
    "TimeWindow": [{
      "Interval": "17:00:00-09:00:00"
    }]
  }
}
</pre>
As you can see, everything in EventPattern is a Perl5 pattern.
<p>
The most important thing is to know what properties are available for
certain types of events and their meanings.  The developers are supposed to
document the data schema on each types of events.  If there is no such
documentation, you still are able to figure them out by simply subscribing 
the events with a universal match rule. Once an event is delivered to you,
you will be able to see all its properties.
</p>

<a NAME="Template"></a>
<H3> Template </H3>
<p>
Template is used to present the content of structure data.  In order to
transform an Event into various text content, EventFlow uses a very
simple implementation, just to search and replace each of the referenced
properties from the event on a given template. The template can be loaded from
a template file or defined inline. If you are sure about an existing template
file, it will be very easy to use by just specifying the path to the file.
<p>
A template file is a plain text file with bunch of property names to
reference the values of the properties.  They are stored in the directory
of <TT>/opt/qbroker/templates</TT> on the host running the EventFlow.  Here is
an example of a template file:
<PRE>

This message was automatically generated.
Problem with ##name## on ##hostname##:

##all##

If errors persist, please contact the on-call.

A brief information on the monitor and this type of message can be found at
https://yannanlu.github.io/agent.html###type##
</PRE>
where <TT>##hostname##</TT> is a variable in reference of the <TT>hostname</TT>
property.  Once this template is rendered with an Event, the content
stored in the hostname property will replace the variable.  <TT>##all##</TT>
is a special variable that will be replaced by a formatted content from all
the properties.
</p>
<p>
In case the customer's pager does not accept a big text, you can have this
simple template to include only a few properties of Event:
</p>
<PRE>
Error on ##hotsname##: ##text##
</PRE>

<p>
Template can also be defined explicitly in the configurations. Inline template 
is very easy, too. It allows the end users to define their own templates
without any dependencies. Some users have complained a lot about missing
template files that caused lost of subscriptions. Unfortunately, there is no
published list for all available template files. Moreover, there is no way for
end users to introduce a new template file or update an existing template file
on the hosting server. Before the permanent solutions, the workaround is to
define the inline template explicitly. With an inline template, there is
no worries about the existence of the template files.
</p>
<p>
It is easy to convert the content of an existing template file into an inline
template. You just need to remember to convert every newline char into "\n" and
escape every double quote with a backward slash, "\". Here is an example with
both inline Template and TemplateFile:
</p>
<pre>
{
    ...
    "ProcessMonitor": {
      "Subject": "##priority##: Sport process ##name## died on ##hostname##",
      "TemplateFile": "/opt/event/templates/mail_proc.txt"
    },
    "Default": {
      "Subject": "##hostname##: ##priority## problem with ##name##",
      "Template": "\nThis message was automatically generated.\nProblem with ##name## on ##hostname##:\n\n##compact##\nIf errors persist, please contact the on-call.\n\nA brief information on the monitor and this type of message can be found at https://yannanlu.github.io/agent.html###type##\n",
    },
    ...
}
</pre>

<a NAME="Subscription"></a>
<H3> Subscription </H3>
<p>
Subscription is a ruleset used by EventDispatcher, a MessageNode. It specifies
what events are subscribed and by who and when. It also contains a group of
actions for EventDispatcher to react on the event. EventDispatcher node
uses EventPattern to select events for each customers. Once it finds an
incoming event matching the EventPattern, it will send that event and its
actions to the interlinked EventPersister. The most common actions is to
send an email alert.
</p>
<p>
You can have as many Subscriptions as you want.  Each Subscription has its own
configuration file named after its name plus ".json" extension. The name of
Subscription should be unique in the scope of EventFlow. Here is an example of
subscription for developers:
</p>
<pre>

      "TemplateFile": "/opt/qbroker/templates/mail_elog.txt"
    },
    "MultiFileMonitor": {

    },
    "Default": {
      "Subject": "##hostname##: ##priority## problem with ##name##",
      "TemplateFile": "/opt/qbroker/templates/mail.txt",
    }
  },{
    "URI": "log:///var/log/qbroker/stats/mail_dev.log",
    "Summary": "##date## ##priority## ##name## ##hostname## ##text##",
    "TemplateFile": "/opt/qbroker/templates/append.txt"
  },{
    "URI": "syslog://localhost",
    "Facility": "USER",
    "Message": "DEV: ##priority## ##hostname## ##category## ##name## ##text##",
    "UnixlogMonitor": {
      "Message": "DEV: ##priority## ##hostname## ##category## ##name## ##lastEntry##",
      "Substitution": [{
        "lastEntry": "s/^.*ERROR -//"
      }]
    }
  }],
  "ActiveTime": {
    "TimeWindow": [{
      "Interval": "00:00:00-24:00:00"
    }]
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, this subscription only gets the events with priority of
ERR or CRIT, from one of the machines of subscriber2, subscriber3, persist2,
feedera and feederb, but excluding the events with the name contains NFL, etc. 
The email content will be in the format defined in the template file of
<TT>/opt/qbroker/templates/mail_dev.txt</TT>.  If EventDispatcher finds a match,
the event will be send to <TT>dev@qbroker.org</TT>.
</p>
<p>
Please pay attention to the last <B>ActionGroup</B>.  It is used to send
alert to Netcool via syslog.  Since Netcool can not take structural messages,
we have to build a single line with the <B>lastEntry</B> at the end of it.
We have used Perl5 substitution to cut off the timestamp and something else
on the property of <B>lastEntry</B>.  This is an example of modifying
content of the event.
</p>
<p>
The good thing for Pub/Sub model is that the publishers and subscribers are
fully separated.  The subscriber only needs to know what kind of events
are interested.  The publisher dose not need to worry about who gets what.
</p>
<p>
This json file just defines the Subscription.  You still need to add its name
to the master configuration file, <b>Sub.json</b>, as one of the Subscriptions:
</p>
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Subscription": [
    "mail_dev"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<a NAME="Correlation"></a>
<H3> Correlation </H3>
<p>
Correlation is a ruleset used by EventCorrelator node to group or partition
incoming events for event correlations.  Sometimes, EventFlow gets a big
spike of events and customers get hundreds of alerts due to some kind of
large-scale outages.  Those events are just symptoms.  There may be just
a few root causes behind them.  With EventCorrelator node, EventFlow
will be able to aggregate those events and create a few new events reflecting
the root causes.  The customers can subscribe the newly created events and
get more accurate alerts.  Currently, this feature is still in experiment.
It is mainly used to merge multiple related events into a single event to
reduce the volume of the alerts.
</p>
<p>
You can have as many correlations as you want.  Each correlation can has its own
configuration file named after its name plus ".json" extension. The name of
every correlation should be unique in the scope of EventFlow.  Here is an
example of correlations set up to merge all events on NFS services:  
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "all_jcms_nfs",
  "Classname": "org.qbroker.event.EventSummary",
  "Type": "MessageSummary",
  "Site": "DEVOPS",
  "Category": "NFS",
  "Description": "event correlation on all JCMS NFS disks",
  "MinimumEventCount": "2",
  "EventExpiration": "900",
  "EventPattern": [{
    "priority": "^(ERR|CRIT)$",
    "hostname": "^jcmsprod\\d+$",
    "name": "_nfs$",
    "type": "^ScriptLauncher$"
  }],
  "XEventPattern": [{
    "status": "^[eE]xception$"
  }],
  "Summary": ["date", "priority", "name", "status", "hostname", "text"]
}
</pre>
<p>
The json file just defines the correlation. You still need to add the following
to the master configuration file, <b>Sub.json</b>, as one of the Correlations:
</p>
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Correlation": [
    "all_jcms_nfs"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
Even though Correlation also has the EventPattern and similar actions like
a Subscription, it is not designed to work on individual events.  Its job
is to select the related events out of the incoming events and aggregate
upon all of them.  It then publishes a new event as the result of the action.
</p>

<a NAME="Escalation"></a>
<H3> Escalation </H3>
<p>
Escalation is a ruleset used by EventMonitor node to monitor and react on
incoming events for event escalations. Sometimes, end users are interested
in temporal behaviors of certain events. As you know, individual events are
sessionless. If there is a way to maintain sessions on certain events, it
will be helpful. One of the use cases of Escalation is to establish
sessions and manage them on events.
</p>
<p>
Most of the modern monitors send only one alert for a well defined failure.
There is no follow-ups nor reminders even if the failure still persists.
If the users have missed this alert, there may be a big concequence. Most
of the customers ask for the reminding or escalating feature. So that if
the problem has not been closed or acknowledged within certain time, their
managers or oncalls should get an escalated notification. With Escalation,
it is seay to set up a ruleset for this kind of purpose.  Here is an example
of Escalation with the session support:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "newrelic",
  "EventPattern": [
    {
      "priority": "^(ERR|INFO)$",
      "site": "^NEWRELIC$"
    }
  ],
  "KeyTemplate": "##category##:##hostname##:##name##",
  "ResetPriority": "INFO",
  "EscalationPriority": "CRIT",
  "TimeToLive": "1800",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "EscalationMask": "6",
  "Template": "##category##:##hostname##:##name## that ##event## has not been cleared within 30 min",
  "CopiedProperty": [
    "name",
    "category",
    "site",
    "type",
    "policy_name",
    "condition_name",
    "incident_id",
    "severity",
    "hostname",
    "status",
    "url",
    "details"
  ]
}
</pre>
where this ruleset tries to create sessions on ERR events from NEWRELIC
based on the value of KeyTemplate. Each session will be terminated by INFO
events with the same key. Otherwise it will expire in 30 min and generates
an escalation event with priority of CRIT. This escalated event can trigger
a paging alert as a reminder. The chance to miss both the orginal notification
and the escalation is really rare.

<p>
The json file just defines the escalation. You still need to add the following
to the master configuration file, <b>Sub.json</b>, as one of the Escalations:
</p>
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Escalation": [
    "newrelic"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
