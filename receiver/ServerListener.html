<p>
ServerListener is a JMS message producer that listens to a ServerSocket and
accepts socket connections from it.  Once there is a new connection, it checks
out a thread to handle the authentication on the socket.  The thread reads the
byte stream, converts them into an ObjectEvent and invokes authentcation method
on it.  If successful, it sends a response message back to the socket.  Before
the thread exits, it sets the socket to the event and puts the message to the
output XQueue.  ServerListener supports flow control and allows object control
from its owner.  It is fault tolerant with retry and idle options.  The maximum
number of client connections is determined by both Capacity and Partition of
the XQueue.  Backlog is the queue length of the server socket listener.

Currently, ServiceNode is the only the MessageNode that can process the messages
from ServerListener.

Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for ServerListener.
