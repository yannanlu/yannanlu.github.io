<p>
StreamReceiver is a JMS message producer that listens to an InputStream and
reads the bytes out of the stream, parses them into a message and puts the
message to the output XQueue.  StreamReceiver supports flow control and allows
object control from its owner.  It is fault tolerant with retry and idle
options.
</p>
<p>
StreamReceiver supports various types of stream based data sources, in terms of
the scheme such as tcp, comm and file.  The operations of read and respond are
supported.  For example, it can be used to receive messages from a serial port.

Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for StreamReceiver.

Here is an example of StreamReceiver:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_serial",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.StreamReceiver",
  "URI": "comm:///dev/term/a",
  "Device": "/dev/term/a",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "Operation": "read",
  "XAMode": "0",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "BufferSize": "4096",
  "SOTBytes": "0x01",
  "EOTBytes": "0x04",
  "BaudRate": "9600",
  "DataBits": "8",
  "StopBits": "1",
  "Parity": "None",
  "DisplayMask": "4"
}
</pre>
where it reads the byte off the serial port of /dev/term/a.
