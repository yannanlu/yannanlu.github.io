<p>
FileReceiver is a JMS message producer that monitors a file on a server,
retrieves the file and loads the content into a JMS message.  The new JMS
message will be put into the internal XQueue as the output.  It supports flow
control and XA.  Fault tolerance with auto reconnections is built in.

<p>
In case of the script, please make sure to redirect stderr to stdout
or close stderr, since FileReceiver only reads from its stdout.

Here is an example of FileReceiver:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_file",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.FileReceiver",
  "URI": "ftp://panda/www/wdap/rrd/monitor.html",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "Operation": "retrieve",
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "XAMode": "0",
  "Username": "qbadm",
  "Password": "xxxx",
  "PauseTime": "30000",
  "StandbyTime": "60000",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "StringProperty": {
    "FileName": "/www/wdap/rrd/monitor.html"
  },
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "file",
      "URI": "ftp://panda/www/wdap/rrd/monitor.html",
      "Type": "FileMonitor",
      "User": "qbadm",

it will retrieve the file and puts the content into the message.
