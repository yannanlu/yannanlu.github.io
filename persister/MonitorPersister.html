<p>
MonitorPersister is a JMS message consumer that persists ObjectMessages.
It listens to an XQueue and receives ObjectMessages from it.
The incoming message is supposed to contain a task map.  MonitorPersister
runs the task as a monitor and removes the message when it completes.  If there
is an event escalated from the moniotor, the returned task will contain it with
other updates.  So MonitorPersister is a worker executing the tasks of
on-demand monitors.
