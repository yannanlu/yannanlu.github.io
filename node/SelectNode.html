<p>
SelectNode parses the payload of JMS Messages and selects the portions of
the content according to certain rules.  For each selected chunk of the
content, SelectNode creates a new TextMessage and stores the data into it.
It also copies the properties of the original message into the new messages
and passes them through the outlink of done.  According to the rulesets,
SelectNode filters the incoming messages into three outlinks: bypass for
those original messages, nohit for those messages do not belong to any
rulesets, failure for the messages failed at the selecting process.

<p>
SelectNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each ruleset
defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also defines the operations
to select content from the messages and other parameters for the group.
If a ruleset has the preferredOutLink defined, SelectNode will route the
messages to its outlink without any actions.  StringProperty determines what
properties to be copied over from the original message to the new messages.
If it is null, nothing will be copied over.  If it is empty, all properties
will be copied over.  Otherwise, only those properties defined in
StringProperty will be copied over. If StoreField is defined for a ruleset,
it must be a full path to a local file. SelectNode will retrieve the content
from the external file. This is good in case the size of content is too
large for a message.
</p>
<p>
The default operation is to split the content via the given delimiters.
The split items will be selected for the ruleset. Alternatively,
if Pattern is defined in a ruleset, SelectNode will parse the content with
the pattern. All the matched items will be selected for the ruleset. If
XPathExpression is defined, SelectNode will use it to select DOM nodes from
the XML document. The text representation of each selected DOM node will be
stored to every outgoing message. If JSONPathExpression is defined, SelectNode
will use it to select JSON objects from the JSON payload. Pattern, XPath and
JSON path support selections with dynamic variables.
</p>
<p>
SelectNode also allows developers to plug-in their own select methods.
In this case, the full ClassName of the selection implementation and its
SelectorArguments must be well defined in the rulesets.  The requirement on
the plug-ins is minimum.  The class must have a public method of
select(String text) that takes a String as the only argument.  The return
object must be a list of String for selected items on success.  Each of
the element of the list will be stored to the outgoing message.  In case of
failure, null should be returned.  It also must have a constructor taking
a Map with a unique value for the key of Name, or a List, or just
a String as the single argument for the configurations.  SelectNode will
invoke the method to get the list of the selected items from each incoming
message.
</p>
<p>
If CountField is defined for a ruleset, the total count of selected items
will be set to the specified field of the incoming messages. In case of the
split operition with given delimiters, the total count will be set at the
end of the operation. It means those new messages will not have this
property set. For other cases, the total count will be set right after the
items are selected. Therefore, the total count can be copied over to the
newly created messages.  The downstream can use this count to terminate the
aggregate sessions or loops.  In order to set the property at CountField,
the incoming message must be writeable. In most of the cases, you can use
the receivers to set a dummy property on all incoming messages since
it will make them writeable.
</p>
<p>
If XAMode is defined in a rulset, it will overwrite the default value
defined on the node level. If the XAMode of a ruleset is on, SelectNode
will make sure all the outgoing messages are delivered before routing the
original message to bypass. Otherwise, the orginal message will be routed
to bypass right after those newly created messages dispatched. In this case,
SelectNode will not wait on their delivery.
</p>
<p>
SelectNode always adds an extra ruleset for the nohit messages.
This nohit ruleset is always the first ruleset with the id of 0.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But
SelectNode always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for bypass,
the third for failure and the last for nohit.  They all can share the same
name, too.  For the first outlink, if it is partitioned, you must define
the same Partition explicitly on every selection ruleset.
</p>

<p>
The select operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of SelectNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for SelectNode.

</TABLE>
where PreferredOutLink can only be defined for bypass rulesets.  In this case,
the messages of the group will not be parsed.  Here is an example
for the bypass ruleset:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it routes the messages to the outlink of BYPASS.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the ruleset for the default selection via delimeter.
If StoreField is defined, the content of the file specified by StoreField will
be parsed for selection.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "disk_io",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "type": "disk_io"
    }],
    "EOTBytes": "0x0a",
    "Offtail": "1",
    "XAMode": "1",
    "TextMode": "1",
    "DisplayMask": "0",
    "StringProperty": {
    },
    "CountField": "Count"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where EOTBytes specifies the newline as the delimiter. Offtail of 1 trim the
newline off the line.  The empty StringProperty tells the node to copy over all
properties of the original messages.  CountField is set to Count that will
store the count of split lines.  The downstream node will terminate the session
once it sees the message with this property.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example to select items via Pattern.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "email",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^email$"
    }],
    "Pattern": "[^;]+;?"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where the rule tries to select all email addresses separated by semi-colon.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example to select items via XPath.  
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "xpath",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^xml$"
    }],
    "XPathExpression": "//Monitor/text()"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where the rule tries to select all items of Monitors defined in Agent.xml.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of SelectNode:
<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_select",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.SelectNode",
  "Description": "select items from text",
  "Operation": "select",
  "LinkName": "items",
  "Capacity": "32",
  "DisplayMask": "4102",
  "Debug": "1",
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "local",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "service": "."
    }],
    "XJMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "operation": "^upload$"
    }],
    "Partition": "0,24",
    "StringProperty": {
    },
    "EOTBytes": "0x0a",
    "Offtail": "1",
    "XAMode": "1",
    "TextMode": "1",
    "DisplayMask": "1"
  }],
  "OutLink": [{
    "Name": "selected",
    "Capacity": "32",
    "Partition": "0,24"
  },{
    "Name": "done",
    "Capacity": "48",
    "Partition": "32,8"
  },{
    "Name": "failure",
    "Capacity": "48",
    "Partition": "24,4"
  },{
    "Name": "nohit",
    "Capacity": "32",
    "Partition": "24,4"
  }]
}
</pre>
