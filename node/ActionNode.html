<p>
ActionNode processes incoming JMS messages and takes the predefined actions
according to the rulesets and the content of the incoming messages.  As the
escalation of actions, ActionNode may generate a new JMS message.  All the
escalation messages will be routed to the outlink of done.  For all the
incoming messages, ActionNode routes them into three outlinks: bypass for
all the processed incoming messages, nohit for those messages do not belong
to any rulesets, failure for the incoming messages failed in the process.

<p>
ActionNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize incoming messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each
rule defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also defines its actions
and the rules to generate new messages for the group.  Different groups may
have different actions and/or different parameters.  For an escalation
message, ActionOrder determines its delivery order relative to the incoming
message.  ActionOrder takes one of the three values: "none", "first" and
"last".  By default, it is set to "none" and there is no order defined on
the newly generated messages.  If it is set to "first", ActionNode will
send out the new message first and wait for its delivery.  Then it will
have the incoming message going through the bypass outlink.  If it is set
to "last", the incoming message will go through the bypass outlink first.
Upon the completion of its delivery, ActionNode sends the escalation
message through the outlink of done.
</p>
<p>
The default action of ActionNode is to escalate messages in different message
types.  For example, if the incoming message is a MapMessage, the escalated
message can be a TextMessage.  If FormatterArgument is defined, the incoming
message will be duplicated and then be formatted based on the list of format
operations.  It is similar to FormatNode, except for that it only formats the
escalated messages.  It is also similar to DuplicateNode, except for that
the only copy will be formatted before the escalation.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the user defined rulesets, ActionNode always creates one extra
ruleset, nohit.  The ruleset of nohit is for those messages not hitting any
patterns.  Please remember, there is no one-to-one relationship between the
candidate messages and the escalation messages.  The escalation messages
will be stored into the RULE_PEND field of the rulesets.  The rule-level
property displaying and resetting are mutual-exclusively determined by the
DisplayMask and the StringProperty of their own rulesets.  If DisplayMask
is not defined in a ruleset or it is set to 0 or -1 (by default), its
StringProperty will be used to reset the string properties of the escalation
messages.  Otherwise, its StringProperty will only be used to display the
details of the escalation messages.  On the node level, DisplayMask and
StringProperty control the displaying result of all incoming messages.  But
if the DisplayMask of a ruleset is set to -1, that rule will inherit the
DisplayMask and the StringProperty from the node for display control on
the rule level.
</p>
<p>
ActionNode also supports customized actions via plugins. In this case, the
full ClassName of the plugin and its ActionArgument must be well defined
in the ruleset.  The developer of the plugin action is supposed to document
the details of ActionArgument.  ActionNode will load the plugin and invokes
the action on the messages of the ruleset.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But ActionNode
always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for bypass, the third
for failure and the last for nohit.  Any two or more outlinks can share
the same outlink name.  It means these outlinks are sharing the same output
channel.

<p>
The operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of ActionNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for ActionNode.

where FormatterArgument lists the format operations for the escalated
messages.  PreferredOutLink can be defined for bypass rulesets only.
In this case, the messages of the group will not be processed.
Here is an example of the preferred ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it routes the messages to the outlink of BYPASS.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the default action ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "toText",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "BodyType": "^map$"
    }],
    "MessageType": "jms_text"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it assumes that the incoming messages of the group are MapMessages. The
ruleset converts the MapMessage into a TextMessage and escalates it.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of ActionNode:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_action",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.ActionNode",
  "Description": "react upon messages",
  "Operation": "escalate",
  "LinkName": "omn",
  "Capacity": "32",
  "DisplayMask": "6",
  "Debug": "1",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "notice",
    "ActionOrder": "last",
    "DisplayMask": "0",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSTimestamp": "."
    }],
    "FormatterArgument": [{
      "FiledName": "JMSPriority",
      "DataType": "int",
      "Template": ["3"]
    },{
      "FiledName": "name",
      "Template": ["MSF"]
    },{
      "FiledName": "category",
      "Template": ["CLUSTER"]
    }]
  }],
  "OutLink": [
    "escalation",
    "bypass",
    "failure",
    "nohit"
  ]
}
</pre>
where it duplicates the messages, formats them and escalates them.
