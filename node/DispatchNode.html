<p>
DispatchNode is a router node that dispatch messages to various destinations
with the support of load balance and/or redundancy.  The incoming JMS messages
will be routed to various destinations (outlinks) according to their content,
the load and preconfigured rulesets. DispatchNode contains one or more
outlinks as the destinations. Those outlinks are grouped exclusively
according to their group names. Within each group, all the oulinks are
equivalent and backing up with each other in case of failure or high load.
</p>
<p>
DispatchNode uses the predefined rulesets to dispatch incoming messages.
These rulesets categorize messages into non-overlapping groups. Therefore,
each rule defines a unique message group. The ruleset also specifies the
association between the message group and the outlinks. For those messages
falling off all defined rulesets, DispatchNode always creates an extra
ruleset, nohit, to handle them. By default, nohit ruleset always uses the
last outlink unless there is one defined explicitly.
</p>

<p>
Content Switch feature is achieved via the rulesets. A ruleset defines a group
of messages and associates them with a dispatch rule.  Currently, it only
supports four types of rules, preferred, roundrobin, weighted and sticky.  If
the type of the ruleset is set to preferred, all the messages in the same
ruleset will stick together and go to the same preferred destination.  In this
case, their message affinity is honored. If the type of the ruleset is set to
roundrobin, the node will dispatch messages in the same ruleset to one of the
available destinations in the group round-robinly. In this case, there is no
fixed destination associated with the group. This way, we can distribute
messages to multiple destinations for load balance. For the type of weighted,
it is similar to the type of roundrobin except for that the routing decision
is based on the load rather than in roundrobin way. If the rule is set to
sticky, the incoming messages will be routed to their destinations according
to the hash values of a perdefined key retrieved from the messages. Similar to
the type of preferred, the message affinity is also honored for sticky rulesets.
</p>
<p>
You can define as many rulesets as you want as long as it is under the limit.
However, DispatchNode always creates an extra ruleset for those messages which
do not match any predefined ruleset.  This extra ruleset is called <B>nohit</B>.
The dispatch rule of nohit is preferred by default.
</p>
<p>
However, there may be a case that one of the destinations is not available
or its load is too high. DispatchNode will find a good outlink and switch
all messages on the bad outlink to the good one as a failover. The pending
messages will be also moved over in the correct order. In order to do that,
you have to enable the dynamic sessions by specifying the parameter of
SessionTimeout. SessionTimeout determines how long to mark the outlink in
pause temporarily before switching it to another outlink. Also you need to
associate all the outlinks to their reports so that the node is able to query
their status and load. You also need to specify the load threshold for the
queue depth. The threshold should contain three numbers, LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH.
The last, you have to set up reporters to watch the destinations and to update
the shared reports. DispatchNode throttles the message flow along all outlinks
according to the shared reports.
</p>
<p>
DispatchNode has also a heartbeat that controls how often it queries the shared
reports and updates the status of rulesets and outlinks. In case the queue depth
is less than LOW, the node treats it as normal.  If the depth is between LOW
and MEDIUM, the node will slow down the flow by skipping the outlink every
other time. If the depth is at or above MEDIUM, the node will mark the outlink
in pause unitl the session timeout.  Then it switches all rulesets out of
the outlink and marks the outlink in standby mode.  If the load on the remote
queue drops to LOW, the node will switch all rulesets back to the original
outlink and marks the outlink in pause until the session timeout.
As you see, SessionTimeout delays the failover and failback so that there is
enough time for those delivered messages processed at their destinations.
In this way, once the other messages are sent to a new destination, the message
affinity is kept to some extent.
</p>
<p>
DispatchNode always adds an extra ruleset for the nohit messages.  It assumes
the last outlink is always for nohit, unless NohitOutLink is defined.
This nohit ruleset is always the first ruleset with the id of 0.
On the node level, DisplayMask and StringProperty control the display result
of outgoing messages.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are three implementation specific
properties for DispatchNode.
<TABLE border=1>

</TABLE>
where SessionTimeout defines the length of the session.  Heartbeat controls
how often to check the shared reports.  If SessionTimeout is 0, there is no
check on the reports.
</p>

<p>
The dispatch operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of DispatchNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for DispatchNode.

</TABLE>
where the current implementation only supports four different types, preferred,
sticky, weighted and roundrobin.  Here is an example of the preferred ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "RuleType": "preferred",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it routes the messages to the outlink of BYPASS.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the sticky ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "tax",
    "RuleType": "sticky",
    "KeyTemplate": "##site##",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "context": "^tax"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it calcautes the hash value from the key and routes the messages
to the outlink mapped from the hash value.  Different keys will have different
hash values.  Therefore, the messages will be routed to different outlinks
according to their key values.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the roundrobin ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "news",
    "RuleType": "roundrobin",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^(news|story|report)$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it routes the messages to all the available outlinks in the round-robin
way.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of DispatchNode:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_dispatch",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.DispatchNode",
  "Description": "dispatch messages according to content",
  "Operation": "dispatch",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "Capacity": "12",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Debug": "11",
  "Heartbeat": "30",
  "SessionTimeout": "120",
  "Threshold": "25,50,100",
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "news",
    "RuleType": "roundrobin",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^(news|storyl|report)"
    }]
  },{
    "Name": "sport",
    "RuleType": "preferred",
    "PreferredOutLink": "cms_2",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^(mlb|nba|nascar)"
    }]
  },{
    "Name": "money",
    "RuleType": "preferred",
    "PreferredOutLink": "cms_2",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^(finance|bank|stocks)"
    }]
  }],
  "OutLink": [{
    "Name": "cms_1",
    "ReportName": "rpt_cms_1_q"
  },{
    "Name": "cms_2",
    "ReportName": "rpt_cms_2_q"
  }]
}
</pre>
where there are two outlinks in this example. They all have their ReportName
defined. The value of ReportName specifies the name of an existing shared
report for the outlink. Those reports are created and updated by certain
reporters in QFlow container.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example for the reporter that creates <b>rpt_cms_1_q</b>:
<pre>
{
  "Name": "rpt_cms_1_q",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.wmq.QueueMonitor",
  "Description": "JMS Q monitor",
  "URI": "wmq://msgprod1",
  "QueueName": "CMS",
  "WaterMark": "20000",
  "ReportName": "rpt_cms_1_q",
  "ReportMode": "cluster",
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "query",
      "Type": "ReportQuery",
      "ReportName": "rpt_cms_1_qhc",
      "ReportClass": "org.qbroker.node.QFlow",
      "ReportKey": ["DstStatus"],
      "PatternGroup": [{
        "Pattern": ["^0$"]
      }]
    }]
  }],
  "ActiveTime": {
    "TimeWindow": [{
      "Interval": "00:00:00-24:00:00"
    }]
  }
}
</pre>
where the reporter creates and updates the report of <b>rpt_cms_1_q</b>.
It checks the queue depth and updates the value of CurrentDepth in the report.
This reporter also depends on another report, <b>rpt_cms_1_qhc</b> which is
maintained by a separate reporter.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example for the reporter that creates <b>rpt_cms_1_qhc</b>:
<pre>
{
  "Name": "rpt_cms_1_qhc",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.jms.JMSHealthChecker",
  "Description": "send a health-check message for testing",
  "URI": "wmq://msgprod1",
  "QueueName": "CMS",
  "Step": "20",
  "ReportName": "rpt_cms_1_qhc",
  "ReportMode": "cluster",
  "ReportKey": ["DstStatus"],
  "JMSPropertyGroup": {
    "JMSType": "monitor/xml",
    "Action": "HealthCheck"
  },
  "MessageBody": "{\"hostname\": \"##hostname##\",\"date\": \"##date##\",\"monitor\":\"This is a health-check\"}",
  "ActiveTime": {
    "TimeWindow": [{
      "Interval": "00:00:00-24:00:00"
    }]
  }
}
</pre>
where the reporter updates the report of <b>rpt_cms_1_qhc</b> once every 20
heartbeats. It sends a health-check message to the queue to test its
writeability. If the test fails, it will disable the report of
<b>rpt_cms_1_q</b>. In turn, it will disable the outlink associated with this
report.
