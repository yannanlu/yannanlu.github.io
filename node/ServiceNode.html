<p>
ServiceNode listens to an input XQ for JMS ObjectMessages with a connected
socket as a request to establish a connection.  The incoming message is also
called a handshake message. It contains the information about the request,
the client and the connection.  ServiceNode matches the properties against
the predefined rulesets to determine which ruleset to handle the connection
request.  ServiceNode extracts the URI from the handshake message and looks
it up in the cache for an XQueue as the transmit queue established for the
connection.  If there is an XQueue in the cache, it means that the service
is ready. Hence ServiceNode will just check out a thread to handle the
connection on the XQueue.  Otherwise, ServiceNode will generate a new
request with a newly created XQueue for either a new consumer or a new
producer to serve on the connection. The request will be sent to the right
outlink according to the ruleset.
</p>

<p>
ServiceNode has two types of outlinks, position-fixed and non-fixed.
There are three position-fixed outlinks: producer for all requests to
a ReceiverPool, consumer for all requests to a PersisterPool, nohit for
all requests not covered by any rulesets.  The non-fixed outlinks are for
the dynamic destinations or sources.
</p>
<p>
ServiceNode also contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each ruleset
defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also specifies the way to
construct the URI and properties for the new Persisters or receivers.  For
those messages falling off all defined rulesets, ServiceNode always creates
an extra ruleset, nohit, to gather stats on them.  Currently, all the nohit
messages will not be routed to the nohit outlink.  Instead, they will be
removed at once by ServiceNode. The stats of pending messages will be tracked
by RULE_PEND for each ruleset.
</p>
<p>
If the XQueue does not exist and the ruleset is up to the consumer pool,
ServiceNode will create a new ObjectMessage as the request for a new
persister thread.  It will also create an XQueue and puts the XQueue and
the URI into the request before sending it to consumer outlink.  Once the
persister is instantiated, ServiceNode will collect the response from the
PersisterPool.  The response contains the persister thread for delivering
the messages to the specific destination.  ServiceNode caches the thread
and the id of the XQueue using the URI as the key.  Then it starts the
proxy thread to pipe all messages from the socket to the XQueue. This
way, ServiceNode is able to deliver JMS messages to arbitrary destinations
according to their URIs and the predefined rulesets dynamically.
</p>
<p>
If the XQueue does not exist and the ruleset is up to the producer pool,
ServiceNode will create a new ObjectMessage as the request for a new
receiver thread.  It will also create an XQueue and puts the XQueue and
the URI into the request before sending it to producer outlink.  Once the
receiver is instantiated, ServiceNode will collect the response from the
ReceiverPool.  The response contains the receiver thread for picking up
the messages from the specific source.  ServiceNode caches the thread
and the id of the XQueue using the URI as the key.  Then it starts the
proxy thread to pipe all messages from the XQueue to the socket.  This
way, ServiceNode is able to pick up JMS messages from arbitrary sources
according to their URIs and the predefined rulesets dynamically.
</p>
<p>
URI is used to identify destinations or sources.  In order to construct the
URI string for an arbitrary destination or source, each ruleset has to define
a template with the name of URITemplate.  Optinally, URISubstitution may be
defined also for a simple substitution.  With them, ServiceNode will be able
to retrieve the URI string from the handshake message.  A ruleset may also
contain a map of DefaultProperty as static or dynamic properties for new
persisters or new receivers. If the URI string is not in the cache, ServiceNode
will try to resolve all the dynamic variables in the map of DefaultProperty
from the handshake message first. Then it also adds the DefaultProperty to the
new ObjectMessage for the either pools to create a new consumer or a new
producer. If any of the operations fails, the handshake message will be removed
and the socket will be closed as a failure.
</p>
<p>
For each new destination/source, ServiceNode uses the same Object message as
the request containing the URI and the XQueue.  The request is sent to either
PersisterPool/ReceiverPool via the corresponding outlink.  Then ServiceNode
frequently checks the response for each outstanding requests.  The response
is supposed to have the status and the persister/receiver thread for the new
destination/source.  ServiceNode will use the thread to monitor its status.
If the response has no such thread, ServiceNode will remove the incoming
message and closes the socket. It will also remove the XQueue and the URI
from the cache. The samething will happen if the request for a new persister
or receiver times out.  MaxRetry is used to control when to timeout the
request on the pool.  It also controls the timeout on a dead persister or
receiver thread.
</p>
<p>
ServiceNode also maintains an active set of XQueues as the transmit queues
for all destinations and sources.  Behind each XQueue, there is at least
one persister or receiver thread processing the messages.  The messages
may be stuck in the XQueue until they are processed, as long as the persister
or receiver is not stopped.  However, if there is no message in the queue,
ServiceNode will mark it idle.  All the transmit queues are monitored
frequently in sessions.  If one of them has been idle for over MaxIdleTime,
its queue will be stopped. Its persister or receiver thread and the transmit
queue will be removed from the cache.  The associated socket will be closed
too.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks.  But ServiceNode
always assumes the first outlink for producer, the second for consumer and
the third for nohit.  The rest of the outlinks are for on-demand destinations or
sources.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are three implementation specific
properties for ServiceNode.

<p>
The proxy operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of ServiceNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for ServiceNode.

</TABLE>
where there are only 4 operations supported: acquire, respond, provide and
publish. DefaultProperty may reference the properties of the handshake
messages for the new persisters or the new receivers. This is the only way
for a requester to pass over complex or hidden properties for new consumers or
new producers.
