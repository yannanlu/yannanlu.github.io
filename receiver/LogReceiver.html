<p>
LogReceiver is a JMS message producer that listens on a log file and picks up
new log entries.  The log entries will be converted into JMS messages.  Then
they will be put into the atached XQueue as the output.  LogReceiver requires
the log file having a decent timestamp on each entry.  Only one operation,
fetch, is supported. LogReceiver also supports flow control and XA.  Fault
tolerance with auto reconnections is built in.
</p>
<p>
LogReceiver supports 4 different transcation mode determined by XAMode.
For XAMode = 1 or 3, the client based transcation is enabled so that the
commit is done by the persister when it completes to persist the message.
If XAMode = 2, the session commit is enabled so that the commit will be done
when the read operation finishes and the log file is closed.  The session
can be forced to termination if MaxNumberMessage is larger than 0 and the
total number of processed logs and dropped logs exceeds it. For XAMode = 0,
the auto commit is enabled.  In this case, the persistence of the state info
is determined by SaveReference.  By default, SaveReference is set to be true.
It means the state info will be flushed to the disk on every processed log
entry. If SaveReference is set to false, otherwise, the state info will not
saved to the reference file.
</p>
<p>
LogReceiver is reliable and super fast. For a typical Apache log, it can
easily pick up more than 10,000 logs per second.  When the log volume is high,
LogReceiver may consume high CPU to catch up the log feeds. To reduce the CPU
usage, the session commit with a reasonable MaxNumberMessage should be
considered.

Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for LogReceiver.

Here is an example of LogReceiver:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_msf_q",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.LogReceiver",
  "URI": "log:///var/log/qbroker/incoming/msf_q",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "OldLogfile": "/var/log/qbroker/incoming/msf_q.1",
  "Operation": "fetch",
  "TimePattern": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS zz",
  "LogSize": "1",
  "ReferenceFile": "/var/log/qbroker/.status/msf_q",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "Partition": "0,0",
  "PatternGroup": [{
    "Pattern": ["."]
  }],
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "ReceiveTime": "1000",
  "MaxNumberMessage": "0",
  "Tolerance": "0",
  "MaxRetry": "2",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "file_q",
      "URI": "file:///var/log/qbroker/incoming/msf_q",
      "Type": "FileTester"
    }]
  }]
}
</pre>
where the receiver monitors the logfile.  If the file is there, it will run.
Otherwise, it just waits.
