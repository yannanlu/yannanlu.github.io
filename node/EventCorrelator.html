<p>
EventCorrelator is a message node that maintains a session for correlations.
EventCorrelator converts incoming JMS messages into JMSEvents and correlates
them according to their content and the predefined rulesets.  All the events
are correlated into non-overlapping groups.  EventCorrelator then creates a
summary event for each of the groups.  As the result, EventCorrelator routes
all the events into four outlinks: done for the summary events created in
the correlations, nohit for those events do not belong to any rulesets,
failure for the events failed in the correlation process and bypass for those
events participated in correlations.  Since EventCorrelator does not consume
any events, any in-coming events has to find a way out via one of the four
outlinks.

<p>
EventCorrelator contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
are used to categorize events into groups.  Each rule defines an EventFilter
for selecting events and an EventMerger for building a summary event on the
group.  An event may belong to multiple groups.  The correlation process will
decide its final ownership based on the size of the groups.  The group with
the largest size will own all the events in the group exclusively.  In case
there is a tie between two groups, the group with the lowest rule ID will be
the winner.  Therefore each ruleset defines a unique event group.  The ruleset
also defines a summary list for the merger to create a new event and to attach
the summary of all the events in the group.
</p>
<p>
EventCorrelator always creates two extra rulesets.   The first one is nohit
ruleset for those events not hitting any patterns.  The other is candidate
ruleset for all incoming events hitting at least one patterns.  Since there
is no way to figure out the final groupships of candidate events before the
correlation, they will be put into candidate group for tracking.  Please
remember, candidate events may not necessarily contribute to any summary
events.  The summary events will be counted by their own rulesets.  Their
property displaying and resetting are mutual-exclusively determined by the
DisplayMask and StringProperty of their own rulesets.  If DisplayMask
is not defined in a rule or it is set to 0 or -1 (default), its
StringProperty will be used to reset the string properties on the summary
events.  Otherwise, its StringProperty will only be used to display the
details of summary events.  On the node level, DisplayMask and StringProperty
control the displaying result of all candidate events.  If the DisplayMask
of a ruleset is set to -1, that rule will inherit the DisplayMask and the
StringProperty from the node for display control on the rule level.
</p>
<p>
It is OK to have a bypass ruleset without any EventMerger.  Any ruleset
with PreferredOutLink defined is called bypass ruleset.  If a bypass ruleset
matches an event,  the event will be routed to the specified outlink directly,
bypassing rest of the correlation process.  It is acting like a jump out of
the loop.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But
EventCorrelator always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for
bypass group, the third for failure and the last for nohit.  Any two or more
outlinks can share the same outlink name.  It means these outlinks are sharing
the same output channel.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there is three implementation specific
properties for EventCorrelator.
<table border=1>
<tr>
<th> Property Name </th> <th>Data Type</th> <th> Requirement </th> <th> Description </th> <th> Examples </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Heartbeat </td> <td> integer </td> <td> optional </td> <td> timeout in second for a session </td> <td> 7200 (default: 86400) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> SessionTimeout </td> <td> integer </td> <td> optional </td> <td> timeout in second for a session </td> <td> 7200 (default: 86400) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> SessionSize </td> <td> integer </td> <td> optional </td> <td> timeout in second for a session </td> <td> 7200 (default: 86400) </td>
</tr>
</table>
where SessionTimeout determines how often to clean up expired topics from the
topic cache.  If SessionTimeout is larger than zero, any cached topics will
expire if their idle time exceeds SessionTimeout.  Those expired topics will be
removed from the topic cache in the next session cleanups to save resources.
</p>

<p>
The correlation operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of
EventCorrelator.  Here are complete properties of rulesets for the node of
EventCorrelator.

<table border=1>
<tr>
<th> Property Name </th> <th>Data Type</th> <th> Requirement </th> <th> Description </th> <th> Examples </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Name </td> <td> alphanumeric with no spaces </td> <td> mandatory </td> <td> name of the ruleset </td> <td> event </td>

</tr>
</table>
where EventPattern selects the events based on their content.  Aggregation
lists all the aggregate operations on the events.  Here is an example of
Aggregation:
<pre>
{
    ...
    "Aggregation": [{
      "FieldName": "body",
      "Operation": "append",
      "DefaultValue": ""
    }],
    ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Currently, there is only one implementation of EventMerger, EventSummary.
Each implementation will have its own configuration parameters.
Here is an example of a ruleset for MessageSummary:
<pre>
{
  "Name": "rule_all_mps",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.event.EventSummary",
  "Site": "MIRA",
  "Type": "MessageSummary",
  "Category": "MPS",
  "Description": "event correlations for all MIRA alerts",
  "MinimumEventCount": "1",
  "SummaryHeader": "Date  Priority  Name  Status  Hostname  Text\n",
  "SummaryTemplate": "##date## ##priority## ##name## ##status## ##hostname## ##text##\n",
  "EventPattern": [{
    "priority": "^CRIT$",
    "site": "^MIRA$",
    "hostname": "^mira(app|web)4prod[12]"
  }],
  "XEventPattern": [{
    "status": "^[eE]xception$"
  }]
}
</pre>
where this rule is of MessageSummary for all events from MIRA.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of EventCorrelator:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_correlation",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.EventCorrelator",
  "URI": "event://localhost",
  "Operation": "correlate",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "LinkName": "bymin",
  "Heartbeat": "30",
  "SessionSize": "100",
  "SessionTimeout": "120",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "DisplayMask": "6",
  "Debug": "1",
  "StringProperty": {
    "priority": "",
    "name": "",
    "hostname": "",
    "site": "",
    "category": ""
  },
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "shortcut",
    "PreferredOutLink": "action",
    "EventPattern": [{
      "priority": "^DEBUG$"
    }],
  }, "all_ardendo", "all_mps", "all_dam_log", "reset_ardendo"]
  "OutLink": [{
    "Name": "action",
    "Capacity": "1024",
    "Partition": "0,768"
  }, "action", "action", "action"]
}
</pre>
where the first rule is for bypass.  The rest of them are defined externally.
