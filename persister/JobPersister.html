<p>
JobPersister listens to an XQueue and receives JMS Messages as the job
requests. There are two types job requests. The first one is the init
request with complete job information. The other is the request on the
current job such as a query of the progress data or a command to abort
the job, etc. Once the persister gets a job init message, it will initialize
the job and starts to process it. Usually, it takes a while to process a
job request. While the job is running, the persister is also listening to
the XQueue for messages. The most common messages are the queries for
progress data on the job. In this case, the persister will load the progress
data to the message and removes it from the queue. If the request is to
abort the running job, the persister will abort the job and resets the
return code. The message will be removed from the queue. In case the message
is another job init request while a job is running, the persister will just
reset the error code on the message and removes it from the queue. Once
the job is done, the job init message will be acknowledged and removed
from the queue.

<TH> Scheme </TH> <TH>Operation</TH> <TH> Description </TH>

<TR>
<TD> ftp/ftps/sftp </TD> <TD> upload </TD> <TD> upload the file to a remote server </TD>

Here is an example of JobPersister:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "pstr_script",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.persister.JobPersister",
  "URI": "script://localhost",
  "LinkName": "script",
  "Operation": "test",
  "ScriptField": "Duration",
  "SessionTimeout": "300",
  "DisplayMask": "6",
  "StringProperty": {
    "Duration": "",
    "Key": ""
  }
}
</pre>
where it expects the message containing the property of Duration that specifies
the number of seconds to sleep.
