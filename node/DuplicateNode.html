<p>
DuplicateNode duplicates incoming JMS messages to various selected
destinations.  It has two types of outlinks, primary as of the first outlink
and non-primary as of rest of outlinks.  All the incoming messages always
go out through the primary outlink.  Their duplicates will be routed to their
selected non-primay outlinks.

<p>
DuplicateNode may also contain a number of predefined rulesets.  These
rulesets categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each
rule defines a unique message group.  If a ruleset has the preferredOutLink
defined and it is same as the primary (the first) outlink, DuplicateNode
will route the messages of the group to the primay outlink without any
duplicate actions as a bypass.  Any other bypass will be forced to the
primary outlink since the messages going out of non-primary outlinks are
not collectible.
</p>
<p>
A ruleset may define a list of the outlinks as the selected non-primary
outlinks for the duplicated messages.  If any selected outlink is either
the primary or not existing, DuplicateNode will ignore it with a warning.
If the selected outlinks are not defined or empty, DuplicateNode will
assign the default list that contains all non-primary outlinks.  But if
PreferredOutLink is defined in the ruleset, the ruleset will be treated as
a bypass ruleset.  For those messages falling off all defined rulesets,
DuplicateNode always creates an extra ruleset, nohit, to handle them.
Nohit ruleset is always a bypass rule to the primay outlink.
</p>
<p>
There is a transaction control on the primary (first) outlink.
The XAMode can be defined on the node level or on the rule level.
The XAMode on the rule level will overwrite the one on the node level.
If the XAMode of the node is on, all non-primary outlinks will wait for
the transaction completed on the primary outlink before their propagation
unless it is set off on certain rules.  Therefore, it is possible to loss
messages on the non-primary outlinks, since non-primary outlinks have no
transaction support.  However, if the XAMode of the node is off, all the
non-primary outlinks will propagate with no wait.  Therefore, there is a
chance that the messages either double fed or lost on non-primary outlinks.
All non-primary outlinks support OverFlowOption that takes three options:
KeepNew, KeepOld and HoldOn. OverFlowOption determines what to do if the
outlink gets stuck or overflown. KeepNew will have the old messages removed
for the new messages. KeepOld is just to drop the new messages. HoldOn will
block the operations.
</p>
<p>
DuplicateNode always adds an extra ruleset for the nohit messages.
This nohit ruleset is always the first ruleset with the id of 0.
On the node level, DisplayMask and StringProperty control
the display result of outgoing messages.
</p>
<p>
The duplicate operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of DuplicateNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for DuplicateNode.

where PreferredOutLink can be defined for bypass rulesets only.  In this case,
the messages of the group will not be duplicated.  Here is an example of
the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "primary",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^no_dup$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it routes the messages to the primary outlink without duplication.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the generic duplication ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "dup",
    "XAMode": "0",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSMessageID": "."
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it duplicates the messages to all the non-primary outlinks.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the duplication ruleset with SelectedOutLink.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "proxy",
    "XAMode": "0",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "notificationType": "^(1|10)$"
    }],
    "SelectedOutLink": ["PROXGEN_MSF_IN"]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it duplicates the messages to the selected outlinks only.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of DuplicateNode:
<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_duplicate",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.DuplicateNode",
  "Description": "duplicate messages",
  "Operation": "duplicate",
  "LinkName": "root",

  "WaitTime": "20",
  "XAMode": "0",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "all",
    "XAMode": "0",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "."
    }]
  }],
  "OutLink": ["primary", {
    "Name": "archive",
    "Capacity": "64",
    "OverflowOption": "KeepOld"
  }
}
