<p>
CollectNode listens to an input XQueue for JMS messages and assigns them
to various destinations as the requests according to their content and
preconfigured rulesets.  It then collects the responses for each outstanding
requests and routes them to their next destinations.  It has two types of
outlinks, position-fixed and non-fixed.  There are three position-fixed
outlinks: done for all completed requests, failure for the messages failed
in the collecting process, nohit for those messages not covered by any
rulesets. They are also called the final exits since all the incoming messages
have to exit through one of them at the end. The non-fixed outlinks are called
collectibles to fulfill requests.
</p>

<p>
CollectNode also contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These
rulesets categorize requests into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each
rule defines a unique request group.  The ruleset also specifies the
the initial outlink for the group.  It may also contains a task list that
defines the association between each task and its next outlink.  Therefore
a ruleset is just like a workflow.  For those messages falling off all
defined rulesets, CollectNode always creates an extra ruleset, nohit,
to handle them.  All the nohit requests will be routed to nohit outlink.
</p>
<p>
For each incoming request, CollectNode sends it to its associated worker
via the initial outlink.  Then CollectNode frequently checks the response for
each outstanding requests.  The response is supposed to have the status and
the requested content.  Based on its status, the response as a JMS message
will be transferred to its next outlink according to the preconfigured
task list.  A task list is just like a workflow.  It controls which outlink
is the next at each step.  A task contains three outlinks for different
scenarios: success, failure and exception. By default, these outlinks are same
as the first 3 non-collectible outlinks, respectively. But they can be
overridden by any valid outlinks as defined for the task. Once a response has
been collected, CollectNode will evaluate its return code and decides which
outlink is the next.  The message will be routed to that outlink according
to the task list.  CollectNode also supports branches.  In case of failure
or exception, if its outlink is a collectible and it is not the same as the
success outlink, CollectNode will find the first leading task with the same
outlink on success for the branch support. As the result, all the tasks in
between will beskipped. Otherwise, CollectNode will just ignore any failure or
exception, and proceed on the current task as if the previous task is a success.
A leading task of a branch is the task immediately following any exit task.
An exit task is the task with non-collectible outlink on success.
Therefore a request message will be able to go through a list of outlinks
step by step as configured.
</p>
<p>
As an option, a task can also specify a single data field of the message to
be formattable.  In order to do that, you need to define a single Template
and/or a single TextSubstitution for that field.  The message will be
formatted before it is put to next outlink on success.  If it is on failure,
or exception, the formatter rule will be bypassed.  However, a task may
define an ErrorCode as the indication for the failure or exception scenario.
In this case,  CollectNode will store the defined ErrorCode into the
ReturnCode property of the message before putting it into the non-collectible
failure outlink.  Since the ruleset itself is the default task, it also can
have the data field, the template and the substitution defined. If all tasks
have completed without errors, the ReturnCode property of the message will be
reset to null before its final exit.
</p>
<p>
In an MT env, it may get deadlocked due to circular dependencies among
the task outlinks.  CollectNode implements walk-sweep method to collect
messages with circular dependencies.  But it may take long time for an
outlink to have vacancies.  If a new message can not find vacancy in
its next task queue,  CollectNode will keep retry up to 10 times and then
roll the message back to the input XQueue. The message will be dequeued
again and the same format rule will be applied once more before to put it
to its task queue.  Therefore, please make sure the first format rule of
a ruleset is stateless.  If you have a stateful format rule as the default
task, please create a stateless task and add the new task before it.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks.  But
CollectNode always assumes the first outlink for out, the second for failure
and the third for nohit.  The rest of the outlinks are collectibles for
responses.
</p>
<p>
By design, CollectNode is supposed to use collectible outlinks to fulfill
reqeusts. But sometimes, the nohit outlink may be used for cascaded requests.
This overloading role will cause conflicts with the exception handling on tasks.
For example, if a task gets an exception on the message, CollectNode will
terminate the workflow and routes the message to the nohit outlink. Since the
message has not been fully processed yet, it may cause issues downstream.
In this case, the default outlink for exceptions can be reset to the failure
outlink on the next task. Hence any exception will have the message routed
to the failure outlink rather than the overloaded nohit outlink.

<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are three implementation specific
properties for CollectNode.

The collect operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of CollectNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for CollectNode.

</TABLE>
where NextTask lists the operation tasks on the message.  Here is an example
of NextTask:
<pre>
{
    ...
    "NextTask": [{
      "Success": "script",
      "FieldName": "body",
      "Template": "/home/damadmin/bin/qbSend.sh ##AssetID## 1",
      "ErrorCode": "5"
    }],
    ...
}
</pre>
where Success specifies the outlink if the previous task is successful.
Before routing the message to script, its body will be formatted with the
given tempalte.  The variable, ##AssetID##, will be replaced by the value of
the message property of AssetID.  It has not defined the outlink for failure
nor exception.  By default, they share the same outlinks as the node. Therefore,
if the previous task fails, the message will be routed to failure outlink
without being formatted. ErrorCode is to overwrite the ReturnCode property of
the message if it exits at the outlink of either failure or exception (nohit).
</p>
<p>
As the rule of thumb, a message going out via any position-fixed outlink will
not be formatted by the task. So the node will ignore any format part if the
exit is one of the position-fixed outlink. If the exit outlink is the first
position-fixed outlink, the ReturnCode property of the message will be removed
to keep it clean. If a message falls into a rule of either nohit or preferred,
there is no any task invoked on it. You can still set ReturnCode property by
defining it in StringPropery for the rule. This way, you can have all messages
with completed tasks exit clean without ReturnCode property set. The rest of
messages, such as failed, bypass, nohit, will have its ReturnCode property set.
</p>
<p>
In fact, CollectNode is just like a task manager to dispatch the message and
the task to each of the workers.  Once the task is completed, it collects the
result and goes to the next task until the workflow ends.  The real jobs are
done by those workers.  So it is very important to line up all the workers with
the node.
