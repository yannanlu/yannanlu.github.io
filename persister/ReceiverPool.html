<p>
ReceiverPool is a JMS message consumer that creates, destroys and maintains
multiple pools of on-demand receivers.  It listens to an XQueue for requests
carried by ObjectMessages.  The incoming message is supposed to contain a task
map with the URI and a transmit XQueue, etc. ReceiverPool evaluates the URI
to figure out the details of the request.  If the request is to ask for a new
receiver, it first looks up the classname of the implementation based on the
URI and the given properties.  Then ReceiverPool tries to check out the pool
of the classname from the cache.  If there exists the receiver pool for
the implementation, it just checks out a new instance of the receiver
with the given properties.  Otherwise, ReceiverPool will create a new pool
for the classname and checks out a new instance of the receiver from it.
It then starts up a new thread on the receiver and returns the thread back.
The requester is supposed to monitor the status of the thread in order to
tell the status of the receiver.  The requester is also able to control the
receiver via the associated transmit queue.  ReceiverPool will frequently
monitor the status of all active receivers in every heartbeat.  If any one
of them is stopped or closed, ReceiverPool will checkin the receiver and
clean up the cache.  If the request is to return the used thread, it will
check in both the thread and the receiver.
</p>
<p>
URI is used to identify the data source and the implementation.  ReceiverPool
parses the URI string and creates a map with all XML properties from the
key-value pairs specified in the query-string.  Therefore, requesters can add
multiple properties to the query-string for a new receiver.  In case the URI
contains its own query-string, the URI separator, <b>&amp;URI=&amp;</b>, must
be used to separate the original query-string and add-on properties. So please
carefully define the add-on properties in the query-string of the URI.
ReceiverPool also allows default properties defined for each implementation.
If any of the default properties is missing in the URI, PersisterPool will copy
it to the XML property map before the instantiation of the MessageReceiver.

<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for PersisterPool.
