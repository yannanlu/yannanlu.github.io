<p>
EventFlow is a centralized Event broker that supports Event Pub/Sub
services and Event correlations. It periodically fetches the new events
from EventCollector, a centralized Event logging system running inside a web
server of Nginx. Any applications, including MonitorAgent, can send or publish
events to the service of EventCollector via REST requests.  EventFlow picks
them up and processes the events in their original order.  End users and
applications can subscribe certain events according to their content, priority
and/or the origin.  EventFlow will deliver the events to the customers.
Besides, it is common to have EventFlow to store every event to Elasticsearch
for analysis. If there is an enterprise event center, EventFlow can escalate
events to it also. Here is the diagram of a monitoring system with
visualizations on both metrics and events.

EventCollector requires Nginx. EventFlow requires qbroker-1.1.0.jar.

<a NAME="Installation"></a>
<H2> Installation </H2>
<p>
EventFlow is just an instance of QFlow. You can find the installation
details at <a href="flow.html#Installation"> QFlow </a>.
</p>
<p>
EventCollector needs to be installed on the same box. Please follow the
instruction for <a href="webadmin.html#Nginx"> WebAdmin </a> to install the web
server for EventCollector.  After EventFlow is installed, you need to
configure it to fit your requirements. The following sections are going to
talk about operations and configurations.

Once EventFlow is installed and configured properly, you should have
the following filesystem layout:

<p>
The normal operation tasks involve start, stop, restart, reload, troubleshoot
the log files, subscription management and deployment.  EventFlow keeps
its configuration files in <TT>/opt/qbroker/flow/EVENT</TT>. The external
subscriptions are in <TT>/opt/qbroker/sub</TT>. Among the various configuration
files, the master configuration files are most important.  They are
<TT>/opt/qbroker/flow/EVENT/Flow.json</TT> for EventFlow and
<TT>/opt/qbroker/sub/*/Sub.json</TT> for external subscriptions.
Here is an example:
<a HREF="misc/Sub.json">Sub.json</a>.  The details on the configurations
will be covered by a dedicated section.  Here we will focus on how to start,
stop, restart, and reload from command line on the local box and where are
the logs.
</p>
<p>
To start EventFlow, go to <TT>/opt/qbroker/init.d</TT> and run
<I>./S50QFlow_EVENT start</I> as the owner or root.  If this command is not
invoked by its owner, it will try to su to the owner and probably prompt for
the password of the owner.  EventFlow runs as <TT>qbadm</TT> for the repository.
In case you want it to restart applications owned by others, you should use
sudo for the access.  Please check with sudo's man pages on how to allow
a user to run scripts on behalf of someone else.  There is plenty of examples
on internet.  You may find some helpful examples.
To stop EventFlow, go to <TT>/opt/qbroker/init.d</TT> and run
<I>./S50QFlow_EVENT stop</I> as the owner or root.  The alternative way to
operate on EventFlow is to use WebAdmin's operation view to start/stop/restart
it remotely.
</p>
<p>
If you are lucky, EventFlow's process will be running as a daemon.
Otherwise, you need to troubleshoot the problem.  Always check the errors
in <TT>/var/log/qbroker/QFlow_EVENT.log</TT> and
<TT>/var/log/qbroker/QFlow_EVENT.out</TT>.  You should run
<I>/opt/qbroker/init.d/S50QFlow_EVENT status</I> to check if the process is
running or not. If you are still not able to start EventFlow, please ask
around for help.
</p>

<a NAME="Configuration"></a>
<H2> Configuration </H2>
<p>
EventFlow is a Java container hosting two different types of components.
The first one is a group of Reporters which are MonitorReport objects used
to monitor the internal state and the external environment.  The second type is
a Flow, a MessageFlow object to process events from various sources. 
In fact, EventFlow is really an instance of MessageFlow where event is
the message to carry application data.  Here is the diagram of the MessageFlow:
</p>
<IMG VSPACE=10 ALIGN=TOP SRC="flow/QFlow_EVENT.jpg" />
<p>
The building blocks of a MessageFlow are MessageReceiver, MessagePersister
and MessageNode.  MessageReceiver is to pick up events from various sources.
MessagePersister is to deliver events to various destinations.  MessageNode
has a set of rules to process events. Among various implementations of
MessageNode, the most important ones are EventCorrelator, EventMonitor and
EventDispatcher.  EventCorrelator contains a set of rulesets for event
correlations. Those rulesets can be defined in the MessageNode configuration
files, or in a separate set of json files. EventMonitor is to keep tracking
on selected events and their states. EventDispatcher as the instance of
MessageNode is used to dispatch or publish events. It contains multiple
rulesets that are also called subscriptions. Each subscription contains an
EventSelector, and an ActionGroup for actions on the event. By default, all
subscriptions stay in the same folder. But for easy management, they may be
stored in separate folders based on their customers. In this case, it will be
much easy to manage their access control separately. Those subscriptions are
called the external subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
There are two different type of configuration tasks. The first type is of
administration tasks on the EventFlow container and workflow. The main
purpose of this type of tasks is to maintain the feature set on the container
and manage the rulesets for various customers. The second type is of
management tasks on external subscriptions and other rulesets for end users.
Here we will focus on the adminitration tasks only.
</p>
<p>
The configuration files of EventFlow are actually a set of json files. They all
locate in <TT>/opt/qbroker/flow/EVENT</TT>.  The master configuration file
is <TT>Flow.json</TT>.  Here is an example of <TT>Flow.json</TT>: 
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "Flow",
  "Site": "DEVOPS",
  "Type": "QFlow",
  "Category": "EVENT",
  "Heartbeat": "60",
  "LogDir": "/var/log/qbroker",
  "LogDatePattern": "'.'MM",
  "ConfigDir": "/opt/qbroker/flow/EVENT",
  "MailHost": "localhost",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "Operation": "query",
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "XMode": "1",
  "MaxNumberFlow": "1",
  "ConfigRepository": "repository_flow",
  "IncludePolicy": {
    "org.qbroker.node.EventCorrelator": "Ruleset",
    "org.qbroker.node.EventMonitor": "Ruleset",
    "org.qbroker.node.EventDispatcher": "Ruleset"
  },
  "Receiver": [
    "rcvr_event_log"
  ],
  "Node": [
    "node_parser",
    "node_switch",
    "node_format",
    "node_correlation",
    "node_monitor",
    "node_dispatcher_node"
  ],
  "Persister": [
    "pstr_pool",
    "pstr_pool",
    "pstr_pool",
    "pstr_done",
    "pstr_null",
    "pstr_failure",
    "pstr_nohit"
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>
From this example of the master configuration file, you will see two parts.
The first part is the properties for the container of EventFlow itself.
It specifies how often to run each of reporter components (heartbeat in second),
where to log, where to send emails and where to find other configurations, etc.
The second part lists all the components, such as Reporters, Receivers,
Nodes and Persisters.  The definition of each components should be
either in the master file or in a separate json file at the configuration
directory.  The normal administration task is to add, remove or modify those
components according to the customers' needs. Once the configuration is ready,
you can follow the operation instructions to start it up.
</p>
<p>
EventFlow is a complex system.  Among the four different types of
components, Node should be the focus for the admins. For end users,
the subscriptions should be the focus. If ConfigRepository is configured, you
can use WebAdmin to deploy changes dynamically without bouncing the container.
Otherwise when any change has been deployed to EventFlow, it requires
a bounce to activate the change.
</p>

<a NAME="Receiver"></a>
<H3> Receiver </H3>
<p>
A Receiver is a MessageReceiver object.  It is used to get events from
various sources.  To learn about MessageReceiver, you may check this link,
<a HREF="flow.html">QFlow</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can have as many Receivers as you want.  Each Receiver has its own
configuration file named after its name plus ".json" extension.
The name of every Receiver should be unique in the scope of EventFlow.
Here is an example of LogReceiver:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_event_log",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.LogReceiver",
  "Type": "LogReceiver",
  "URI": "log:///var/log/nginx/event.log",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "Partition": "0,0",
  "Operation": "fetch",
  "OldLogFile": "/var/log/nginx/event.log.1",
  "ReferenceFile": "/var/log/qbroker/.status/event.log",
  "LogSize": "1",
  "MaxNumberLogs": "4096",
  "TimePattern": "ss.SSS",
  "PatternGroup": [{
    "Pattern": ["."]
  }],
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "XAMode": "0",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "DisplayMask": "6",
  "MaxRetry": "2",
  "QuietPeriod": "10",
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "event_log",
      "URI": "file:///var/log/nginx/event.log",
      "Type": "FileTester"
    }]
  }]
}
</pre>
This json file just defines the receiver. You also need to merge the following
lines to the master configuration file, <TT>Flow.json</TT>:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Receiver": [
    ...
    "rcvr_event_log"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>

<a NAME="Persister"></a>
<H3> Persister </H3>
<p>
A Persister is a MessagePersister object.  It is used to deliver events to
various destinations.  To learn about MessagePersister, you may check this link,
<a HREF="flow.html">QFlow</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can have as many Persisters as you want.  Each Persister has its own
configuration file named after its name plus ".json" extension.
The name of every Persister should be unique in the scope of EventFlow.
Here is an example of EventPersister:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "pstr_pool",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.persister.EventPersister",
  "URI": "event://localhost",
  "Operation": "invoke",
  "LinkName": "pool",
  "DisplayMask": "6"
}
</pre>
<p>
This json file just defines the persister.  You also need to merge the
following lines to the master configuration file, <TT>Flow.json</TT>:
</p>
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Persister": [
    ...
    "pstr_pool"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>

<a NAME="Node"></a>
<H3> Node </H3>
<p>
A Node is a MessageNode object.  It is used to process events with
various rulesets.  To learn about MessageNode, you may check this link,
<a HREF="flow.html">QFlow</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can have as many Nodes as you want.  Each Node has its own
configuration file named after its name plus ".json" extension.
The name of every Node should be unique in the scope of EventFlow.
Here is an example of configuration for EventMonitor:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_monitor",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.EventMonitor",
  "Operation": "monitor",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "LinkName": "action",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Debug": "1",
  "StringProperty": {
    "hostname": "",
    "name": "",
    "priority": ""
  },
  "Ruleset": {
    "Name": "shortcut",
    "PreferredOutLink": "pub",
    "EventPattern": [{
      "priority": "^DEBUG$"
    }]
  }, "event_tracker"],
  "OutLink": ["pub", "pub", "pub", "pub"]
}
</pre>
<p>
In the example above, there are two rulesets.  The first ruleset is a Map.
It explicitly defines all details for the ruleset.  On the contrast, the second 
ruleset only has its name listed.  There is no detail defined.  It is assumed
that the container will load the detail definition in that name and insert the
object to the ruleset list at the same position.  Therefore, this example shows
two different ways to define the ruleset. If you decide to use the indirect
way, make sure the classname of the node is defined in IncludePolicy block of
the master master configuration file for the message flow.
</p>
<p>
This json file just defines the message node.  You also need to merge the
following lines to the master configuration file, <TT>Flow.json</TT>:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Node": [
    ...
    "node_monitor"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is the example of configuration for EventCorrelator:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_correlation",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.EventCorrelator",
  "Operation": "correlate",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "LinkName": "parsed",
  "Heartbeat": "30",
  "SessionSize": "100",
  "SessionTimeout": "120",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Debug": "1",
  "StringProperty": {
    "hostname": "",
    "name": "",
    "priority": ""
  },
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "shortcut",
    "PreferredOutLink": "action",
    "EventPattern": [{
      "priority": "^DEBUG$"
    }]
  }, "all_mps"],
  "OutLink ": ["action", "action", "action", "action"]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In the example above, there are two rulesets.  The first ruleset is a Map.
It explicitly defines all details for the ruleset.  On the contrast, the second 
ruleset only has its name listed.  There is no detail defined.  It is assumed
that the container will load the detail definition in that name and insert the
object to the ruleset list at the same position.
</p>
<p>
This json file just defines the message node.  You also need to merge the
following lines to the master configuration file, <TT>Flow.json</TT>:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Node": [
    ...
    "node_correlation"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of configuration for EventDispatcher node:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_dispatcher",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.EventDispatcher",
  "Operation": "dispatch",
  "Capacity": "1024",
  "LinkName": "pub",
  "XAMode": "1",
  "DisplayMask": "7",
  "Debug": "1",
  "StringProperty": {
    "uri": "",
    "status": ""
  },
  "Ruleset": ["page_mis", "devteam"],
  "OutLink": ["pool", "remote", "failure", "remote"]
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In the example above, there are two rulesets with only names but no details.
So we can assume any detail functionalitis for them. As an example, let's
assume the first ruleset is a name referencing a subscription to page MIS group.
The second ruleset is assumed to reference a ConfigList for DEV team. For the
detail of a subscription, it will be discussed in another article. For the
detail of a ConfigList, it will be covered in the next section. Here we just
need to know that a ConfigList is a list of subscriptions stored and
managed in a separate repository.
</p>
<p>
This json file just defines the message node.  You also need to merge the
following lines to the master configuration file, <TT>Flow.json</TT>:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Node": [
    ...
    "node_dispatcher"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<a NAME="ConfigList"></a>
<H3> ConfigList </H3>
<p>
A ConfigList is an object referencing a list of external rulesets. It is
designed for separations between the workflow admins and the end users.
EventFlow is a highly configurable workflow engine for event pub/sub
services. The subscriptions of the end users are the part of the configurations
for the workflow. The end users should be able to manage their own event
subscriptions. On the other hand, the details of the workflow and the pub/sub
engine should be hidden from the end users. So a list of external rulesets for
end users' subscriptions is a good solution. This way, end users are able to
focus on their business needs while they are managing their subscriptions.
ConfigList is the hook linking the external rulesets to the nodes of
EventFlow.
</p>
<p>
For example, the dev team wants to subscribe the alerts from their
applications. So we can set up an instance of ConfigList for the dev team.
Here is the example:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "Name": "devteam",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.monitor.PropertyMonitor",
  "Site": "DEVOPS",
  "Type": "PropertyMonitor",
  "RuleType": "ConfigList",
  "Category": "WDAP",
  "Description": "external config list",
  "Step": "1",
  "Tolerance": "1",
  "MaxRetry": "2",
  "MaxPage": "2",
  "QuietPeriod": "12",
  "ExceptionTolerance": "2",
  "URI": "http://panda:8082/sub/devteam/sub.json",
  "EncryptedAuthorization": "xxxx==",
  "MaxBytes": "0",
  "Pattern": "Last-[mM]odified: (\\w+, \\d+ \\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+ \\w+)",
  "DateFormat": "EE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zz",
  "Timeout": "60",
  "Debug": "1",
  "IgnoredField": ["LastModified"],
  "Basename": "Sub",
  "ComponentGroup": {
    "Sub": ["Subscription", "Correlation", "Escalation"]
  },
  "PropertyFile": "/opt/qbroker/sub/devteam/Sub.json",
  "DataField": {
    "node_dispatcher": "Subscription",
    "node_correlation": "Correlation",
    "node_monitor": "Escalation"
  },
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "repo_sub",
      "ClassName": "org.qbroker.monitor.URLMonitor",
      "URI": "http://panda:8082/sub/devteam/sub.json",
      "Operation": "HEAD",
      "EncryptedAuthorization": "xxxx==",
      "MaxBytes": "0",
      "Pattern": "Last-[mM]odified: (\\w+, \\d+ \\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+ \\w+)",
      "DateFormat": "EE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zz",
      "Timeout": "60",
      "TimeOffset": "0"
    }]
  }],
  "ActiveTime": {
    "TimeWindow": [{
      "Interval": "00:00:00-24:00:00"
    }]
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, this example defines an instance of PropertyMonitor with its
URI pointing to the repository for devteam's subscriptions. Once it is
deployed, the EventFlow will download the list of configuration for devteam's
subscriptions periodically. Those subscriptions should be defined in the
service of devteam under the application of <b>Sub</b>. If another team wants
a dedicated repository for their subscriptions, the admin just need to create
a new hook similar to that of devteam for them.
