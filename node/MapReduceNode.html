<p>
MapReduceNode picks up JMS messages as the requests and creates multiple
copies of the message as the requests according to the predefined rulesets.
Those newly created messages will be sent to multiple outlinks. The node
will collect the responses from them and aggregates the results according to
the reduce policies. If all the responses are collected and aggregated,
the final result will be loaded to the incoming message as the response.
The incoming message will be routed to the outlink of done. In case of
failure, the incoming messages will be routed to the outlink failure. If
none of the rulesets matches the incoming messages, they will be put to the
outlink of nohit. These three outlinks are also called the final exits.
The rest of the outlinks are collectibles to fulfill the map requests.

<p>
MapReduceNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups via the property filter.
Therefore, each ruleset defines a unique message group.  If the associated
outlink is none of the fixed outlinks and Aggregation is defined in a
ruleset, it is a ruleset of map/reduce. There may be other parameters for
the map and reduce operations. For example, TimeToLive and Quorum are two
important parameters for the reduce process.
</p>
<p>
The aggregation on responses is defined in BodyAggregation. It supports the
first, last, append for text, and merge for JSON or XML payload, etc.
In case of merge for JSON payload, JSONPath is required in the map. JSONPath
defines a JSONPath expression that is used to select the data from the
responses. The selected data will be merged as a child node to the parent
node in the aggregated JSON. In case of merge for XML payload, XPath is required
in the map. XPath defines an XPath expression that is used to select the
data from the responses. The selected data will be merged as a child node
to the parent node in the aggregated XML.
</p>
<p>
The default map process is to copy the message body as the request for each
selected outlink. The selected outlinks are defined via the list of
SelectedOutLink. If it is defined in a ruleset, its member can be either
the name of an outlink or a map containing LinkTemplate and FieldName, etc.
If it is not defined for a map-reduce rule, the request will be duplicated
to all collectibles. If a member of SelectedOutLink is a map, the value of
LinkTemplate will be used to determine the name of the outlink dynamically
or statically, depending on whether it contains variables referencing to
certain properties of the message. The value of FieldName will be the
property name of the message for the request. In this case, the node
formats the request out of message and sets the result to that property.
Therefore, it can contain Template and Substitution. This way, each outlink
may have its own request.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks. But
MapReduceNode always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for
failure and the third for nohit.  The rest of the outlinks are for responses.
It is OK for those three fixed outlinks to share the same name.  Please make
sure each of the fixed outlinks has the actual capacity no less than that of
the input XQueue.

Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for MapReduceNode.

where RCField specifies the name of the property for return code.

The aggregation operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of
MapReduceNode.  Here are complete properties of rulesets for MapReduceNode.

</TABLE>
where Aggregation lists all the aggregation operations for the rules.  If
CoundField is defined, it will be used to terminate the session.  Otherwise,
the sesion will be terminated by TimeToLive or SessionSize.  PreferredOutLink
can only be defined for bypass rulesets.  In this case, the messages of the
group will not be aggregated.  Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of BYPASS without processing them.
</p>

Here is an example of the mapreduce ruleset with aggregations:
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "feed",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "path": "."
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "60",
    "DisplayMask": "64",
    "Aggregation": [{
      "FieldName": "ReturnCode",
      "Operation": "first",
      "DefaultValue": "0"
    },{
      "FieldName": "SQLResult",
      "Operation": "sum",
      "DefaultValue": "0"
    }],
    "BodyAggregation": {
      "Operation": "merge",
      "XPath": "//Record"
    }
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of BodyAggregation for XML.
<pre>
{
    ...
    "BodyAggregation": {
      "Operation": "merge",
      "XPath": "//president"
    },
    ...
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of BodyAggregation for JSON union oeration.
<pre>
{
    ...
    "BodyAggregation": {
      "Operation": "union",
      "JSONPath": "Record",
      "KeyTemplate": "##FOLDER##/##PATH##/##MTIME##",
      "KeySubstitution": "s/\\.0$//"
    },
    ...
}
</pre>
where KeyTemplate and KeySubstitution is used to retrieve the unique key from
the data.

Here is an example of MapReduceNode:

    "jmx_panda4"
  ]
}
</pre>
where there are only two rules. The first one maps requests to two separate
outlinks of <b>pgsql</b> and <b>mysql</b>. The results will be stacked on
top of each other. The second rule maps requests to one of the four jmx_xxxx
links with 3 sub-requests. The results will be merged into a single json text.
