<p>
MessageEvaluator is a JMS message consumer that evaluates messages according
to the pre-defined rulesets.  The incoming messages are supposed to specify
what rule to be invoked for the evaluation.  The evaluation consists two
separate steps.  The first one is the pattern match on the content.  The second
is the transformation on the content.  If the pattern match returns true, the
message will be transformed according to the ruleset and its return code will
be reset to 0 for SUCCESS.  Otherwise, MessageEvaluator will only reset its
return code to 1 for FAILURE.  If the evaluation process fails, the return
code will be reset to -1 for EXCEPTION.  MessageEvaluator will not commit any
message.  It just bounces it back by removing it from the input XQueue.
</p>
<p>
MessageEvaluator contains a number of predefined rulesets.  Each ruleset
has its own unique name and the evaluation rules.  It may also contain the
formatting rules or plugins for modifying the content of the messages.
There are many built-in transformation supports.  The default one is the
simple Templates and TextSubstitutions. Others are simple template files, XSLT
templates, XPath evaluations, JSONT templates, and JSONPath evaluations, etc.
MessageEvaluator supports branch ruleset to invoke the certain ruleset
according to the pattern match.  It also supports loop ruleset to invoke
multiple rulesets on the same message.  Each ruleset can define its own
DisplayMask for logings.
</p>
<p>
For the default formatting support, the ruleset is supposed to have a list
of FormatterArgument.  A FormatterArgument contains a name specifying
what to be formatted and two sets of format operations.  The first oeration
set lists format templates in the name of Template.  The other is the list
of substitutions with the name of Substitution.  Each Template appends the
previous non-empty text to the variable and sets the next initial text for
its corresponding Substitutions.  If the first template is null, the initial
text will be the variable itself.  Each Substitution modifies the text
before it is appended to the variable.  The associations between the
Templates and Substitutions are based on their positions.  Either Template
or Substitution can be null for no action and a place holder.  Therefore,
you can insert multiple null Templates so that the associated Substitutions
will be able to modify the same text in turns.  MessageEvaluator will apply
all the operations of FormatterArguments on each SUCCESS message in the
order of the list.  If any of the operations fails, the message will be
marked as EXCEPTION.
</p>
<p>
Besides FormatterArgument, MessageEvaluator also allows to have a simple
template file defined in the name of TemplateFile for a ruleset. In this
case, MessageEvaluator will load the template file at the start up and
stores it into the cache. It will be used to format the message body at the
end of the format process. If NeedChop is defined with the value of "true",
MessageEvaluator will try to chop the newline from the loaded content.
</p>
<p>
For XSLT support, the ruleset must not have any FormatterArgument defined.
Instead, the full path of the XSL template file must be specified in the name
of XSLFile.  If there is any parameters to be set, they should be defined in
the map of XSLParameter.  MessageEvaluator will load the XSL template file,
compiles it at the startup and stores it to cache.  The parameters will be set
dynamically in case there is any reference on the data of the incoming message.
</p>
<p>
MessageEvaluator also supports XPath operatons, such as xmerge and xcut.
XMerge is to merge an XML content stored in XMLField into the XML payload
of the message. The ruleset should define SourceXPath and TargetXPath.
Currently, only append is supported. XCut is to remove the object at a given
XPath expression.
</p>
<p>
For JSONT support, the ruleset must not have any FormatterArgument defined.
Instead, the full path of the JSONT template file must be specified in the name
of JTMPFile.  If there is any parameters to be set, they should be defined in
the map of JSONParameter.  MessageEvaluator will load the JSONT template file,
compiles it at the startup and stores it to cache.  The parameters will be set
dynamically in case there is any reference on the data of the incoming message.
</p>
<p>
MessageEvaluator also supports JSONPath operatons, such as jmerge and jcut.
JMerge is to merge a JSON content stored in JSONField into the JSON payload
of the message. The ruleset should define SourceJSONPath and TargetJSONPath.
Currently, both append and union are supported. JCut is to remove the object
at a given JSONPath.
</p>
<p>
For branch support, the ruleset can reference other existing format rulesets
via the list of Branch.  MessageEvaluator will match message to the patterns
of each ruleset in the order to find the first hit.  Then it applies the very
ruleset on the message breaks the branch.  It allows you to invoke ruleset
according to the content of the message.
</p>
<p>
For loop support, the ruleset can reference other existing format rulesets
via the list of Loop.  MessageEvaluator will match message to the patterns
of each ruleset and applies the formatter to the message if it is a hit.  The
operation continues until the loop ends.  It allows you to invoke a series of
rulesets according to the content of the message.
</p>
<p>
For time window support, the ruleset can evalute the age of the message.
It requires ActiveTime, KeyTemplate and TimePattern to be defined in the
ruleset.  If it is for age, please make sure the threshold contains at
lease two numbers.  For occurrence, please make sure it contains only
one negative number.
</p>
<p>
For static caching support, the ruleset must have StaticCache defined as
a map with key-value pairs. Optionally, ResultField, KeyTemplate and
KeySubstitution can be defined also. ResultField specifies where to store
the cache result. By default, it is stored to message body. KeyTemplate
and KeySubstitution are used to retrieve the cache key. By default,
KeyTemplate is "##body##".
</p>
<p>
MessageEvaluator also supports customized formatters via plugins. In this case,
the full ClassName of the plugin and its FormatterArgument must be well defined
in the ruleset.  The developer of the plugin formatter is supposed to document
the details of FormatterArgument.  MessageEvaluator will load the plugin and
invokes the method to format the messages of the ruleset.
</p>
<p>
Besides format rulesets, MessageEvaluator also supports rulesets of parsers,
such as SimpleParser or XPath. For SimpleParser, ParserArgument has to be
well defined.  For XPath, XPathExpression has to be well defined.
MessageEvaluator will parse the message and sets the paramters as specified
by the ruleset.
</p>
<p>
MessageEvaluator always copies the original value of RCField to the
OriginalRCField before resetting it.  If you want to evaluate the value of
the property in RCField, please ensure to reference the OriginalRCField in
your pattern group.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for MessageEvaluator.

The operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore, the
configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of MessageEvaluator.
Here are common properties of rulesets for MessageEvaluator.

</TABLE>
where JMSPropertyGroup and PatternGroup are used as filters. If the incoming
message failed to be selected, MessageEvaluator will set the return code to
EXEPTION. DisplayMask overrides the persister level mask for logging.
