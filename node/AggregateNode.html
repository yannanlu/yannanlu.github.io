<p>
AggregateNode maintains dynamic sessions and aggregates JMS messages according
to their content and the predefined rulesets.  It filters them into three
outlinks: bypass for all the aggregated messages, nohit for those messages do
not belong to any predefined rulesets, failure for the messages failed at the
aggregations.  AggregateNode will create a new message, TextMessage, as the
result of the aggregation for each unique key in every session.  These new
messages will be flushed to the outlink of done when their sessions terminate.

<p>
AggregateNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each ruleset
defines a unique message group.  A ruleset also defines the unique keys
for the group and how to aggregate the messages sharing the same keys.
Each group has its own cache for aggregations. The aggregation process is
maintained by sessions with certain lifetime. For each unique key, there is
a cached message with aggregated data. A ruleset also defines parameters
used for the aggregation, such as DynamicSession, TimeToLive, SessionSize,
CountField and TerminationField, etc. The lifetime of a session is
determined by TimeToLive in seconds. Therefore, AggregateNode knows when to
terminate an aggregation session. However, a session can belong to a key or
all the keys in a ruleset. If DynamicSession is set to true on a ruleset,
each key of that ruleset will have its own session. When the session is
terminated, only the cached message for that key will be flushed to the
outlink of done. By default, DynamicSession is set to false. It means all
the keys in a ruleset will share the same session by default. In this case,
if the session is terminated, all the cached messages for that ruleset
will be flushed out at the same time.
</p>
<p>
The aggregation on message body is defined separately in BodyAggregation.
It supports the first, last, append for text, and merge for JSON or XML payload.
In case of merge for JSON payload, JSONPath is required in the map. JSONPath
defines a JSONPath expression that is used to select the data from the
responses. The selected data will be merged as a child node to the parent
node in the aggregated JSON. In case of merge for XML payload, XPath is required
in the map. XPath defines an XPath expression that is used to select the
data from the responses. The selected data will be merged as a child node
to the parent node in the aggregated XML.
</p>
<p>
Currently, AggregateNode supports 4 different ways to terminate a session.
First, TimeToLive specifies the lifetime of any key in the cache for the
ruleset. If a key expires in the cache, its session is terminated. The
expired keys will not participate the aggregation process. But they may
not be flushed out until the next flush operation. Second, if the total
number of cached keys in a ruleset exceeds the SessionSize, AggregateNode
will try to find any expired keys to flush to save space. If CountField is
defined in a ruleset, AggregateNode will retrieve the total count from
the incoming messages. The total count will be used to terminate the
aggration session on the key. If TerminationField is defined, AggregateNode
will check that property on each incoming message. If an incoming message
has a non-empty value on that property, it will be treated as the terminator.
The aggregation session for the key will be terminated as a result.
</p>
<p>
AggregateNode also supports plugins for customized aggregations.  In order
to support plugins, ClassName of the implementation should be defined in
the ruleset.  The class should have a public method of aggregate() that
takes two JMS messages as the arguments.  The first message is the incoming
one.  The second message is the cached message for aggregations.  The method
is supposed to return null for success or an error text for failures.  It
should not modify the incoming message by all means.
</p>
<p>
Apart from user defined rulesets, AggregateNode always creates one extra
ruleset, nohit.  The ruleset of nohit is for those messages not hitting any
matches.  The number of aggregation messages is storded into the RULE_PEND
field.  Their property displaying and resetting are mutual-exclusively
determined by the DisplayMask and StringProperty of their own rulesets.  If
DisplayMask is not defined in a ruleset or it is set to 0 or -1 (by default),
its StringProperty will be used to reset the string properties of the
aggregation messages.  Otherwise, its StringProperty will only be used to
display the details of aggregation messages. On the node level, DisplayMask
and StringProperty control the displaying result of all candidate messages.
But if the DisplayMask of a ruleset is set to -1, that rule will inherit
the DisplayMask and the StringProperty from the node for display control
on the rule level.
</p>
<p>
AggregateNode also supports single key sessions.  In order to enable the
single key session, SessionSize has to be set to 1.  In this case,
AggregateNode is assuming that all keys of input messages are already
grouped in packs.  It means all messages with the same key stay together.
Any new key will trigger the previous aggregation session terminated.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But
AggregateNode always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for bypass,
the third for failure and the last for nohit.  Any two or more outlinks can
share the same outlink name.  It means these outlinks are sharing the same
output channel.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for AggregateNode.

</TABLE>
where SessionSize is the default maximum number of cached messages in a rule.
Heartbeat controls how often to check the session state.  A session can be
terminated by size-overflow, by expiration, by count or by a terminator message.

The aggregation operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of
AggregateNode.  Here are complete properties of rulesets for AggregateNode.

</TABLE>
where Aggregation lists all the aggregation operations for the rules.  If
CoundField is defined, it will be used to terminate the session.  Otherwise,
the sesion will be terminated by TimeToLive or SessionSize.  PreferredOutLink
can only be defined for bypass rulesets.  In this case, the messages of the
group will not be aggregated.  Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }],
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of BYPASS without processing them.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the aggregation ruleset.
<pre>

  ...
