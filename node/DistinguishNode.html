<p>
DistinguishNode is a filter node that applies the distinction operation on
each incoming messages to remove the duplicated copies according to their keys
and optional versions.  It filters messages into four outlinks: done for
all distinct messages, bypass for those duplicate messages, failure for
those messages failed in the distinguishing processes, and nohit for all
the messages that do not hit any explicitly defined ruleset.
</p>

<p>
DistinguishNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each rule
defines a unique message group. The ruleset also specifies the parameters
to control the message filtering process on the group, such as KeyTemplate.
If KeyTemplate is defined for a ruleset, it is the ruleset for distinction.
DistinguishNode maintains a global cache for all the keys in order to track
them. Furthermore, the content filtering can be enabled or disabled
dynamically via the sessions and monitors. If SessionTimeout is set to 0,
it will only do static filtering. The number of the keys cached is tracked
via the RULE_PEND field for each rule. If VersionTemplate is defined in a
ruleset, DistinguishNode will retrieve the version info from the messages
to enforce the version control. It means the messages with older versions
will be treated as the duplicates. DistinguishNode also creates one extra
ruleset by default for all nohit messages. The reserved word, nohit, is the
name of this default ruleset.
</p>
<p>
DistinguishNode also supports the cache ruleset which is similar to a
regular distinction ruleset. The only difference on the configurations is
that the former has also defined RuleType as "cache". However, the routing
policy for a cache ruleset is different from what of the distinction
ruleset. It is designed for message flow clusters only. Even though both
distinction rulesets and cache rulesets are defined for the node, their
activities are mutually exclusive on any given instance of the node.
Therefore, a DistinguishNode with active cache rulesets is called on the
cache mode.
</p>
<p>
One of the use cases of cache rulesets is that an active-passive message
flow cluster with the only one DistinguishNode. In this case, the master
flow processes all the incoming messages. By desing, those messages only
activate the distinction rulesets of the DistinguishNode. As the contrast,
the worker flow does not process any incoming messages. Therefore, the
distinction rulesets of the DistinguishNode are not active at all.
Meanwhile, the master flow also escalates each processed message to the
worker flow via the cluster communication channels. On the worker side,
the container of the worker flow is supposed to forward the escalated
messages to the DistinguishNode. Those escalated messages are supposed to
activate the cache rulesets of the DistinguishNode. Once an escalated
message arrives, the DistinguishNode on the cache mode extracts the key from
the message and saves it to the global cache. The cache ruleset on the
worker flow has a different routing policy. Since those messages have
already been processed on the master, the messages with the unique keys
will be routed to nohit outlink. The rest of the messages will be routed
to failure outlink, if there is any. This way the cache on the worker flow
always keeps in sync with the master. When a failover occurs, the worker
flow with the latest cache will be ready to be promoted to the new master.
Since the cache on the new master is current, any duplicated message will
not be routed to the done outlink. If you are going to implement the
active-passive message flow cluster with a DistinguishNode with cache rules,
please make sure its uplink has the 2nd half of the cells unused. The unused
partition will be reserved for escalations so that the container is able to
forward the escalations.
</p>
<p>
DistiguishNode always adds an extra ruleset for the nohit messages.
This nohit ruleset is always the first ruleset with the id of 0.
On the node level, DisplayMask and StringProperty control the display result
of outgoing messages.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the four fixed outlinks.  But
DistiguishNode always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for
bypass, the third for failure and the last for nohit.  The outlink of failure
or nohit can share the same name with the first two others.  It means these
outlinks may share the same output channel.

Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for DistinguishNode.

where SessionTimeout defines the length of the session.  Heartbeat controls
how often to check the session state.  If SessionTimeout is 0, there is no
check on the sessions.

The distinguish operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of
DistinguishNode.  Here are complete properties of rulesets for DistinguishNode.

</TABLE>
where the implementation only supports three different types of rules,
bypass, distinct and cache.  PreferredOutLink can be defined for bypass
rulesets only.  In this case, the messages of the group will not be processed.
Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "BYPASS",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of BYPASS without processing them.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the distinguish ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "first_job",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "messageType": "8",
      "timeStamp": "."
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "7200",
    "KeyTemplate": "##guid##/##status##"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it extracts the key from the message and checks the key existence in the
cache.  If no, the message will be routed to the first outlink and the key will
be added to the cache.  Otherwise, the message is a duplicate.  The duplicate
messages will be routed to bypass outlink.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the cache ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ...
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "cache_job",
    "RuleType": "cache",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "messageType": "8",
      "timeStamp": "."
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "7200",
    "KeyTemplate": "##guid##/##status##"
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it checks the key in the cache and adds it to the cache.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of DistinguishNode:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "node_distinct",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.node.DistinguishNode",
  "Description": "propagate distinct messages",
  "Operation": "distinguish",
  "LinkName": "MAS",
  "Capacity": "32",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "Debug": "11",
  "Heartbeat": "300",
  "SessionTimeout": "1800",
  "Threshold": "0,50,100",
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "cache_file",
    "RuleType": "cache",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "category": ".",
      "messageType": "6"
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "7200",
    "KeyTemplate": "##serverIP##/##timeStamp##/##notificationType##/##fileURL##"
  },{
    "Name": "first_file",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": "
      "messageType": "6",
      "timeStamp": "."
    }],
    "TimeToLive": "7200",
    "KeyTemplate": "##serverIP##/##timeStamp##/##notificationType##/##fileURL##"
  }],
  "OutLink": ["OMN", "MAS_BACKUP", {
    "Name": "failure",
    "Capacity": "128",
    "Partition": "32,32"
  },{
    "Name": "null",
    "Capacity": "128",
    "Partition": "32,32"
  }]
}
</pre>
where the node is on the cache mode. Since the uplink, <b>MAS</b>, has the
capacity of 32, the partition of (16, 16) is supposed to be reserved for
escalations.
