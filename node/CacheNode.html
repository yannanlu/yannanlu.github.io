<p>
CacheNode picks up JMS messages as the requests and looks for cached
responses according to their content and predefined rulesets. If a valid
cache is available, its content will be loaded to the incoming message
before it is routed to the done outlink. If there is no cache or
the cache has expired, the incoming message will be routed to the
right outlink as the request. Once the response is back, CacheNode will
evaluate the return code and cache the response if it is a success. Then
the message will be routed to the done outlink. In case of failure, the
incoming messages will be routed to the failure outlink. If none of the
rulesets matches the incoming messages, they will be put to the nohit outlink.
Therefore, there are three fixed outlinks, done, failure and nohit. They are
also called the final exits since all the incoming messages have to exit
through one of them at the end. The rest of the outlinks are collectibles
to fulfill requests.

<p>
CacheNode contains a number of predefined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups via the property filter.
Therefore, each ruleset defines a unique message group. If the associated
outlink is none of the final exits and KeyTemplate is also defined in
a ruleset, it is a ruleset of dynamic cache. That outlink is a collectible
used to fulfill requests for caching. In a dynamic cache ruleset, other cache
parameters may be defined as well, such as TimeToLive, RequestType,
DataField, Template and Substitution, etc. TimeToLive controls how long to
cache the result. DataField, Template and Substitution are used to modify
the request for cache. By default, the request is assumed already built-in.
If the associated outlink is one the final exits and KeyTemplate is
defined also, the ruleset is of static cache. In this case, StaticCache is
required to be defined in the ruleset. It is a map with predefined key-value
pairs. Each cache ruleset maintains its own dedicated cache. Hence,
different message groups may have their own ways for the keys and policies.
Further more, CacheNode always creates an extra ruleset, nohit.  Ruleset
of nohit is for all the messages not hitting any of the predefined rulesets.
For a cache ruleset, the number of collected responses is stored in
RULE_PEND.  So it is easy to track the hit ratio of the cache.
</p>
<p>
CacheNode also supports the invalidation rulesets. The invalidation ruleset
is simliar to the cache ruleset.  The only difference is that the former
has also defined TargetRule. TargetRule specifies the name of a cache ruleset
for invaliadations. Its KeyTemplate is used to generate group keys for
invalidations. Each message of an invalidation ruleset will be routed to the
outlink directly. Once the response is successfullycollected, CacheNode will
invalidate the cache of the target ruleset based on the group keys. Currently,
only the request type of JDBC is fully supported.
</p>
<p>
If a ruleset has its preferred outlink to one of the collectibles but
has no KeyTemplate defined, it is a simple rule to collect responses.
For this rule, CacheNode just routs the requests to the outlink and collects
the responses. There is no caching involved with this type of rules.
</p>
<p>
CacheNode maintains a dedicated cache for each of the cache rules. But it
is assumed that the caching keys are unique across all caches. If you run
into key conflict with CacheNode, please use a different instance of
CacheNode.
</p>
<p>
CacheNode has two properties to control timing. They are Heartbeat in sec
and SessionTimeout in sec. Heartbeat is the frequncy to run the sanity
check on pending requests. By default, it is 120 sec. SessionTimeout
controls the caching time for the templates of JDBC queries. By default,
it is 3600 sec.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the three fixed outlinks.  But CacheNode
always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for failure and the third
for nohit.  The rest of the outlinks are collectibles for responses.  It is OK
for those three fixed outlinks to share the same name.  Please make sure each
of the fixed outlinks has the actual capacity no less than that of the input
XQueue.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for CacheNode.

</TABLE>
where MaxGroup specifies the max number of distinct groups for the cache. In
case of JDBC requests, the cached groups are categorized by the names of the
DB tables.  So MaxGroup defines max number of distinct table names for the
databases. SessionTimeout controls how long to cache templates for certain
requests. For JDBC queries, they may contain certain variables to reference
the message properties. CacheNode also caches the request templates.
</p>

<p>
The cache operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of CacheNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for CacheNode.

</TABLE>
where KeyTemplate is to build either the key for cache or the group keys for
invalidation. RequestType specifies the type of the requests for the rule.
Currently, only JDBC request supports invalidations. PreferredOutLink specifies
the outlink for the requests. If it is one of the fixed outlinks (final exits),
the ruleset is a bypass. Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ..
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "done",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of done without processing them.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of CacheNode:

where there are two rulesets, one for cache and the other for invalidation.
