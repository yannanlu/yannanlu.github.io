<p>
JDBCReceiver is a JMS message producer that queries on a JDBC data source
repeatedly and converts the query result into JMS messages, one record for
each message.  The new JMS messages will be put into the internal XQueue as
the output.  JDBCReceiver supports all JDBC implentations via DBDriver.  Only
one operation, select, is supported.  In order to select repeatedly,
DependendyGroup is required to control if the select operation is skipped or
not. Both PauseTime and the Step of the report control the frequency of the
operation. It also supports flow control and XA.  Fault tolerance with auto
reconnections is built in.

Apart from the common properties, there are many implementation specific
properties for JDBCReceiver.

where KeyColumn specifies the name of the column whose value will be used as
an monotonic increasing number or timestamp. If KeyColumn is defined, SQLQuery
is supposed to contain 1 parameter in the its WHERE clause to select new
records. The receiver will set the value before the each query. If ReferenceFile
is defined also, the state info will be persisted to the file. Please make sure
to define DependencyGroup for repeated select. Otherwise, the reciever will stop
after the first query.

Here is an example of JDBCReceiver:

<pre>
{
  "Name": "rcvr_db",
  "ClassName": "org.qbroker.receiver.JDBCReceiver",
  "URI": "jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=devdb1.qbroker.org)(PORT=1530))(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=devdb2.qbroker.org)(PORT=1530))(CONNECT_DATA=(failover=true)(server=dedicated)(Service_name=devdb.qbroker.org)))",
  "Username": "monitor",
  "Password": "xxxx",
  "Operation": "select",
  "SQLQuery": "SELECT message_id, status, apns_delivered_device_count AS "COUNT", to_char(send_started, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS "SEND_TIME", to_char(apns_send_ended, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS "APNS_END" FROM notify_owner.message_log where apns_send_ended >= %%TIMESTAMP:D%% ORDER BY apns_send_ended",
  "LinkName": "root",
  "Partition": "0,0",
  "Mode": "daemon",
  "XAMode": "0",
  "TextMode": "1",
  "KeyColumn": "APNS_END",
  "IDColumn": "MESSAGE_ID",
  "TimePattern": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss",
  "ReferenceFile": "/var/log/qbroker/.status/apns.dat",
  "MaxNumberMessage": "200",
  "Tolerance": "0",
  "MaxRetry": "2",
  "DisplayMask": "0",
  "DependencyGroup": [{
    "Dependency": [{
      "Name": "skipper",
      "Type": "ActionSkipper",
      "Step": "12",
      "ActiveTime": {
        "TimeWindow": [{
          "Interval": "00:00:00-24:00:00"
        }]
      }
    }]
  }]
}
</pre>
where the receiver monitors a the column of APSN_END for new records. There is
one dependency that just wakes up every 12 heartbeat (PauseTime, 5 sec by
default). Therefore, the reciever run the query every min (12 x 5 = 60). In the
SQLQuery, there is one parameter, %%TIMESTAMP:D%%. It expects the latest
timestamp. The receiver will get that value from APNS_END and sets it before
each query. If any records with newer timestamps show up, they will be picked
up by the receiver. For each new record, there is a new message generated and
put to the queue.
