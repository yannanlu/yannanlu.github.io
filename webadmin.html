<h1> WebAdmin </h1>
<p>
WebAdmin is a web application powered by QBroker at the middle tier and RDBMS
database at the backend. With Javascript running at the client side, together
they provide a service of admin console for various applications. The middle
tier is workflow based. So it is very easy to be customized with various
workflows to support different applications. Currently, WebAdmin supports
MonitorAgent, QBroker Flow, JMS Browser and WebShell, etc. With WebAdmin,
users are able to configure/deploy/start/stop various applications.

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>
WebAdmin is a console service for users to manage various applications. It
consists of five subsystems, QBroker, Content Tree, Database, Tomcat and Nginx.
Before getting into the details, let us look at an example that WebAdmin is
used to manage configurations and operations for MonitorAgent, EventFlow and
StatsFlow as a part of a Monitor Network:
</p>
<img src="misc/MonitorNetwork.jpg" />
<p>
where various monitor agents are sending metrics or notifications to some
centralized event collectors either on premises or on cloud via http or https.
Nginx is used on premises to log metrics and notifications to stats_log and
event_log, respectively. Two instances of QBroker Flow pick up data from logs
and process them with a bunch of alerting rules. Eventually all the data are
stored to either InfluxDB or Elasticsearch for visualizations and further
analyses. Grafana is the tool for end users to view and analyze the monitor
metrics and notifications. WebAdmin is the management console for those
QBroker Flows and MonitorAgents on various hosts.
</p>
<p>
Even though WebAdmin Console can be owned by any user and deployed at any where,
here we focus on the standard deployment. In the standard deployment, it is
owned by <tt>qbadm</tt> and homed at <tt>/www/wdap</tt>. As shown in the
following diagram, there are five subsystems in WebAdmin Console. The first
subsystem is an instance of QBroker message flow. The second is an instance of
RDBMS database storing all configurations. The next is the Tomcat servlet
engine hosting the webapp for the WebAdmin Console. Then it is the Nginx that
plays multiple roles, such as the frontend of the webapp, the event collector
and the web server for the static content and the configuration files of the
repository. The last is the content tree which includes the directories for
webapps, javascripts for Webadmin Console, the repository for configurations
and the staging area. The content tree is homed at <tt>/www/wdap</tt>. Here is
the conceptual diagram:
</p>
<img src="misc/webadmin_nginx.jpg" />
<p>
WebAdmin's middle tier is powered by QBroker Flow running inside a Java WebApp
container. QBroker is a message flow based application.  It is very flexible
and easy to be confgiured to fit most of the needs.  Here is the diagram of
the message flow for WebAdmin Console:
</p>
<img src="flow/CONSOLE.jpg" />
<p>
To add a new feature, for example, you just need to add new nodes or modify the
existing nodes. There is no need to write new codes in most cases.
</p>

<a name="QBroker"></a>
<h2> QBroker </h2>
<p>
The installation of QBroker is simple. If your box has web access to
<TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT>. It will be really simple. You just need to
login on the box and run the followinig command to have it installed:
<pre>
wget -O - https://yannanlu.github.io/misc/installQB.sh | sudo bash
</pre>
In some cases, the web access to <TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT> may not be
allowed. So you will have to download the tar ball and the installation
script from <TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT>. Then you need to copy them to
the box for the installation. Here is the procedure with the step-by-step info:
<UL>
<LI> Run the following commands to download the tar ball to your workstation:
<pre>
wget --no-check-certificate https://75.131.197.149/qbroker.tgz
wget https://yannanlu.github.io/misc/installQB.sh
</pre>
</LI>
<LI> Copy the tar ball and the script to the box you are going to install
QBroker.</LI>
<LI> Login on the box on which you are going to install QBroker.</LI>
<LI> Cd to the directory with the tar ball and the script.</LI>
<LI> Run the following command to install:
<pre>
sudo bash ./installQB.sh .
</pre>
</LI>
<LI> You may need to download and build the latest qbroker-x.y.z.jar.</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<a name="Content_Tree"></a>
<h2> Content Tree </h2>
<p>
WebAdmin Console is a web application. It requires a content tree just like a
regular web site. The content tree contains the configuration repository for
all the managed applications, the staging area for the working copies and the
repository for webapps. Each repository of WebAdmin has its own content tree.
Therefore, the first task is to set up the content tree.
</p>
<p>
It is easy to set up the content tree from scratch. Before you start the work,
please make sure the hosting boxes are of the Unix platform. Here we assume
that there is only one box to host the WebAdmin. In order to manage the
configurations for various applications, it is also required the user accounts
and groups for each applications. The installation of QBroker in the previous
step is supposed to create the user account for <tt>qbadm:qb</tt> already.
If your box has web access to <TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT>. You just
need to login on the box and run the followinig command to have it installed:
</p>
<pre>
wget -O - https://yannanlu.github.io/misc/installWdap.sh | sudo bash
</pre>
<p>
In some cases, the web access to <TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT> may not be
allowed. So you will have to download the tar ball and the installation script
from <TT>https://yannanlu.github.io</TT>. Then you can copy them to the
box for the installation. Here is the step-by-step tasks:
<UL>
<LI> Run the following commands to download the tar ball to your workstation:
<pre>
wget --no-check-certificate https://75.131.197.149/wdap.tgz
wget https://yannanlu.github.io/misc/installWdap.sh
</pre>
</LI>
<LI> Copy the tar ball and the script to the box you are going to install
WebAdmin.</LI>
<LI> Login on the box on which you are going to install WebAdmin.</LI>
<LI> Cd to the directory with the tar ball and the script.</LI>
<LI> Run the following command to install the content tree:
<pre>
sudo bash ./installWdap.sh .
</pre>
</LI>
</UL>
Please pay close attention to the output of the script. If there is any error,
you need have it resolved sooner than later.
</p>
<p>
In the content tree, there are some configuration files for customizations.
Before going through them, let us get familliar with the layout of the content
tree.

<p>
For an application, like Agent, there are at least 4 copies of the configuration
files. The first copy is the local copy on the application machines. The
second copy is in the repository, ie, <tt>/www/wdap/docroot</tt>. The third
one is in the database. The fourth one is in the staging area as the working
copy. When a user opens a configuration file, WebAdmin Console retrieves it from
the database. Once changes are made to the file and saved, WebAdmin Console
saves the changes to both the database and the staging area. If the user tries
to preview the file, the console picks up the copy on the staging area. The
changes can be published to the repository via the publish button. The version
on the repository can be deployed to the boxes where the application runs.
</p>

<a name="Database"></a>
<h2> Database </h2>
<p>
WebAdmin stores everything into a database and retrieves them from the database
upon requests.  The database is the subsystem on the domain level.  Multiple
repositories on the same doamin will share the same database.  Even though
WebAdmin supports other databases, like MySQL or Oracle, the standard
deployment requires PostgreSQL database. In most cases, there is no need for
you to install and configure the database by yourself. The DBAs are supposed to
take care of those tasks.  Most likely, the database has already been fully
functional. You will just need to have your WebAdmin Console and the repository
point to it. In case there is no existing database instance ready for you,
you have to install the database with either yum on Centos or apt-get on
Ubuntu. Then you can load the schema by following the instructions below:
</p>
<p>
For PostgreSQL, you need to create the user account and database after the
installation. After switch to the owner of <tt>postgres</tt>, you can run
the following command for the task:
</p>
<pre>
psql
> create user qbdba with password 'xxxx';
> create database qbrokerdb owner qbdba template template1;
> \q
</pre>
where you need to replace <tt>xxxx</tt> with the password for <tt>qbdba</tt>.
<p>
Once the account is created, you can login as <tt>qbdba</tt> to load the
table schema:
</p>
<pre>
psql -U qbdba -h localhost -f /www/wdap/examples/postgresql/schema.sql qbrokerdb
</pre>
where it assumes the database is running on the same box as WebAdmin Console
does. You will be prompted for password on the user of <tt>qbdba</tt>.

<p>
For MySQL, you need to create the user account and database after the
installation.
</p>
<pre>
mysql -u root -pxxxx
> create database qbrokerdb;
> create user 'qbdba'@localhost identified by 'yyyy';
> grant all on qbroker.* to 'qbdba';
> exit
</pre>
where you need to replace <tt>xxxx</tt> with the password for MySQL root
account. For <tt>yyyy</tt>, you need to replace it as the password for
<tt>qbdba</tt>. Once the account is created, you can login as <tt>qbdba</tt>
to load the table schema:
<pre>
cat /www/wdap/examples/mysql/schema.sql | mysql -u qbdba -pyyyy qbrokerdb
</pre>
where <tt>yyyy</tt> is the passwrod for <tt>qbdba</tt>. It also assumes the
database is running on the same box as WebAdmin Console.

<p>
For Oracle, you need to ask DBAs to create the accounts with proper roles
granted. Here is the script for the task:
</p>
<pre>
-- create schema for qb_owner and qb_user on Oracle
create user qb_owner identified by xxxx;
grant connect, resource to qb_owner;
create tablespace qbtbspc default storage (initial 40960 next 40960 minextents 1 maxextents 505 pctincrease 0) datafile 'path_to_data_dir/qbtbspc_01.dbf' size 150M;
alter user qb_owner default tablespace qbtbspc;
create user qb_user identified by yyyy;
grant connect, resource to qb_user;
</pre>
where you need to replace xxxx and yyyy with the real passwords for the users
and path_to_data_dir with the real path for the data files.
<p>
Once the users are created, you should be able to login on the DB to create
the schema for qb_owner. The schema is stored in the content tree:
<tt>/www/wdap/examples/oracle/schema.sql</tt>.
</p>
<p>
After the database and schema are ready, you should have the access info. The
next is to update WebAdmin Console configuration so that it points to the right
database. It will be covered in the section of Tomcat.
</p>

<a name="Tomcat"></a>
<h2> Tomcat </h2>
<p>
The core of WebAdmin Console is a Java web application which can run inside any
standard Java web application container. In the standard deployment of
WebAdmin, Tomcat web server has been chosen as the servlet engine. The
easiest way to install Tomcat on Linux is to use either yum for Centos or
apt-get for Ubuntu.
</p>
<p>
Since Tomcat is the container for the WebAmin Console, it should run as
the user of <tt>qbadm</tt>. Please make sure the instance of Tomcat starts
as the user of <tt>qbadm</tt>. It is kind of tricky to change the user of
the Tomcat instance. Here is the step-by-step instructions for Ubuntu:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop Tomcat with the following command:
<pre>
sudo service tomcat stop
</pre>
</li>
<li> Clean up the cache folder, temp folder and logs via the following commands:
<pre>
sudo rm -fr /usr/share/tomcat/temp/*
sudo rm -fr /usr/share/tomcat/work/Catalina
sudo rm -fr /var/log/tomcat/*
sudo chmod g+w /usr/share/tomcat/temp
sudo chmod g+w /usr/share/tomcat/work
sudo chmod g+w /var/log/tomcat
</pre>
</li>
<li> Use your favorite editor to open the file of <tt>/etc/default/tomcat</tt>.
Make sure the following two lines are uncommented with the right values:
<pre>
TOMCAT_USER="qbadm"
</pre>
</li>
<li>Start Tomcat with the following command:
<pre>
sudo service tomcat start
</pre>
Tomcat instance should be running as <tt>qbadm</tt>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For Centos, it should be similar except for the default setting in
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/tomcat</tt>. But for RHEL 7, the service is managed by
<tt>systemd</tt>. Here is the steps to change the user for Tomcat:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop Tomcat with the following command:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop tomcat
</pre>
</li>
<li> Clean up the cache folder, temp folder and logs via the following commands:
<pre>
sudo rm -fr /usr/share/tomcat/temp/*
sudo rm -fr /usr/share/tomcat/work/Catalina
sudo rm -fr /var/log/tomcat/*
sudo chmod g+w /usr/share/tomcat/temp
sudo chmod g+w /usr/share/tomcat/work
sudo chmod g+w /var/log/tomcat
</pre>
</li>
<li> Update the systemd unit file with the following commands:
<pre>
echo -e "[Service]\nUser=qbadm" &gt; /tmp/custom-user.conf
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service.d
sudo cp /tmp/custom-user.conf /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service.d
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
rm -f /tmp/custom-user.conf
</pre>
</li>
<li>Start Tomcat with the following command:
<pre>
sudo systemctl start tomcat
</pre>
Tomcat instance should be running as <tt>qbadm</tt>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once Tomcat is installed, its configureation folder would probably be
<tt>/etc/tomcat</tt>. If not, check the folder of tomcat7 or tomcat8 under
<tt>/etc</tt> or find out its location. Here we assume the configuration
folder for installed Tomcat is <tt>/etc/tomcat</tt>.  Run the following
command to copy the configuration file for the webamin webapp to its
configuration folder:
</p>
<pre>
sudo cp /www/wdap/examples/broker.xml /etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost
</pre>
<p>
In case the configuration folder is not <tt>/etc/tomcat</tt>, make the necessary
adjustment in the command line.
</p>
<p>
As the webapp container, Tomcat is going to host WebAdmin Console as a Java
application. We need to make sure WebAdmin Console is well configured before
to restart Tomcat. Since database has been installed and configured in the
previous step, we just need to choose the right set of configureation files
for the database. Assuming PostgreSQL is the database for WebAdmin Console,
here are the steps to set up configurations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Run the following commands to deploy Console config files for PostgreSQL:
<pre>
sudo cp /www/wdap/examples/postgresql/WebAdmin/cfg/* /www/wdap/console
sudo cp /www/wdap/examples/postgresql/jaas.conf /www/wdap/console
sudo chown qbadm:qb /www/wdap/console/*
sudo chmod g+w /www/wdap/console/*
</pre>
If your DB is either MySQL or Oracle, you should replace <tt>postgresql</tt>
with either <tt>mysql</tt> or <tt>oralce</tt> in the copy command lines.
</li>
<li> Cd to <tt>/www/wdap/console</tt> and open the following file with your
favorite text editor:<br>
<tt>rpt_global_var.json</tt><br>
please update the values for
<b>Repos_URL, Repos_HOST, DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASS</b>, etc.
</li>
<li> In the same folder, open the following file with your
favorite text editor:<br>
<tt>jaas.conf</tt><br>
please update the values for <b>URI, Username and Password</b> in JDBC block.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
WebAdmin Console also requires users to login for security and accountability.
It supports JAAS (Java Authorization and Authentication API). If you have your
favorit JAAS plugins, you can use them for your WebAdmin Console. By default,
JDBC to the database is used for the JAAS. It means you will have to create
user accounts and manager their permissions. If you want to use Single-Sign-On,
you should update the file of <tt>/www/wdap/console/jaas.conf</tt> and also
update the file of <tt>/www/wdap/webapps/broker/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> for the
new value of JAASLogin.
</p>

<a name="Nginx"></a>
<h2> Nginx </h2>
<p>
Nginx plays multiple roles for WebAmin Console. First, it is the frontend
of web application of Console. With Nginx at the front, it is easy to add
SSL protections. Second, Nginx is used to serve configuration files for
managed applications. All the configuration files are JSON files in plain
text, stored in the repository. Third, Nginx is used to collect POST data
from various sources as the gateway for events, metrics and alerts. The
easiest way to install Nginx on Linux is to use either yum for Centos or
apt-get for Ubuntu.
</p>
<p>
Once Nginx is installed, its configureation folder would probably be
<tt>/etc/nginx</tt>. If not, make sure you find out its location. Here we
assume the configuration folder for installed Nginx is <tt>/etc/nginx</tt>.
Run the following command to copy the configuration file for Nginx to its
configuration folder:
</p>
<pre>
sudo cp /www/wdap/examples/localhost.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/`hostname`.conf
</pre>
<p>
In case the configuration folder is not <tt>/etc/nginx</tt>, make the necessary
adjustment in the command line.
</p>
<p>
Since Nginx needs to read the password file of <tt>/www/wdap/cfg/users.pw</tt>,
please make sure the group ownership of the file is same as the group of
the Nginx process.
</p>
<p>
This concludes the installation and basic configuration of QBroker, Database,
Tomcat, Nginx, and Content tree for a single repository. In case of production,
it is recommended to set up a backup repository and WebAdmin instance with
replications enabled.
</p>

<a name="Dependencies"></a>
<h2> Dependencies </h2>
<p>
Even though all five subsystems of WebAdmin are ready, we still can not
start up WebAdmin Console due to the missing dependencies. As you know,
WebAdmin Console runs as the user of <tt>qbadm</tt>. It will have to have
the right to modify the configurations on behalf the owner of other
applications. It should also be able to restart the applications on the
remote boxes via ssh.
</p>
<p>
In case to deploy the configuration files to a remote box or restart the
application on a remote box, WebAdmin will need the ssh access to the box
as the application owner. In order to have the centralized control over
the remote access, we do not suggest to use ssh keys for the authentications.
The standard deployment is assuming a plain-text password stored in the file
of <tt>/home/user_login/.ssh/user_login.pw</tt>. Therefore, please set up
the password file for the user of <tt>qbadm</tt> as follows:
</p>
<pre>
su - qbadm
cd /home/qbadm
cd .ssh
echo qbadm_password &gt; qbadm.pw
chmod go-rwx qbadm.pw
exit
</pre>
<p>
where you need to replace <b>qbadm_password</b> with the password for
the user of <tt>qbadm</tt>. If there is no <tt>.ssh</tt> directory, you can
run ssh against the localhost to create it. Please do the similar task for
the user of <tt>qbadm</tt>.
</p>
<p>
WebAdmin has a component of EventCollector which collects the incoming events
from various applications. EventCollector will persist incoming events into
the log file, <tt>/var/log/nginx/event_log</tt>. Please make sure the
directory of <tt>/var/log/nginx</tt> having the right permissions. It should
be owned by qbadm:nginx with 2775 permission. EventFlow should also be
configured on the box to pick up the events from the log file.
</p>
<p>
WebAdmin Console requires Expect to run scripts on behalf various users.  If
there is no Expect installed, you need to have it installed installed.  Then
please make sure all the expect scripts in <tt>/www/wdap/bin</tt> have the
right path for expect.  If they are wrong, please update the first line of the
scripts.  Here is an example,
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/expect --
</pre>
where it is assumed the expect locates in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>.
</p>
<p>
In the folder of <tt>/www/wdap/bin</tt>, there are a bunch of symlinks for
various unix commands. They are created by the script of <tt>installWdap.sh</tt>
in the section of installation for Content Tree. Please make sure all of them
are valid. If any of them errored out during the installation of Content Tree,
please have them installed and symlinked with the same name. If you have your
favorite Java, you can update the symlink here on java.

<p>
Finally, WebAdmin Console is ready to start up. Here are the steps to start up
the console:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Run the following command to start up Tomcat:
<pre>
sudo service tomcat restart
</pre>
In case of systemd, try:
<pre>
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
</pre>
</li>
<li> Make sure there is no major errors in the log of
<tt>/var/log/qbroker/Console.log</tt>
</li>
<li> Run the following command to start up Nginx:
<pre>
sudo service nginx restart
</pre>
In case of systemd, try:
<pre>
sudo systemctl restart nginx
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there is no errors, you should be able to launch the admin console with
your web browser pointing to the url of http://your_hostname/console/home.html.
The default admin user is <tt>qbadm</tt> with the password of <tt>qBr0ker</tt>.
Once you are able to login on the WebAdmin Console, you should see a table
view on the working pane as follows:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>VIEW_NAME</th><th>TAB_NAME</th><th>COL_NAME</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>application</td><td>applications</td><td>short_name</td><td>applications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>site</td><td>sites</td><td>site_name</td><td>customer sites</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hostgroup</td><td>hostgroups</td><td>hostgroup_name</td><td>host groups</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>role</td><td>roles</td><td>role_name</td><td>admin roles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>group</td><td>groups</td><td>group_name</td><td>user groups</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>repository</td><td>repositories</td><td>repository_name</td><td>repositories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>elink</td><td>elinks</td><td>elink_name</td><td>links for external information</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
As we mentioned before, if you are setting up a new domain, the database is
almost empty.  You will need to use WebAmin Console to create some basic
objects, such as the current repository, new sites, applications, etc.
First thing first, you need to add your repository to the
repository view.  Double click on the repository on the working pane to
open the repository view.  Then click on <b>Create</b> button on the top
to add your repository to the view.  Here is an example for repository of
PANDA:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>REPOSITORY_NAME</th><th>URI</th><th>PATH</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PANDA</td><td>http://panda:8082</td><td>/www/wdap</td><td>repository for integration team</td>
</tr>
</table>
where <b>URI</b> is for the remote access to the repository, <b>PATH</b>
defines the filesystem path to the repository.  You should always name your
repository in uppercase.  Make sure to replace PANDA with your repository
name and replace panda with your hostname.

<p>
This will also add your repository as the first site to the site view.
Double click on the name of the newly created repository on the summary view
of repository to list all sites in the repository.  The default site will be
there.
</p>

<p>
Next you should create a new application, a new role, a new hostgroup or
a new user group, etc.  The <b>Help</b> button on every view is helpful.  It
explains each properties on every views.  Since Console is used to power
WebAdmin Console, you should create Console as the first application and
then import WebAdmin as the first service.
</p>
<p>
Click on the DOMAIN link below the buttons on the working pane.  You will
see the domain view.  Click on application twice on the working pane to open
the appication's sumary view.  Then click on <b>Create</b> button on the top
to add Console as the first application.  Here is the detail for Console:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>SHORT_NAME</th><th>APPLICATION_NAME</th><th>VERSION</th><th>Type</th><th>VENDOR</th><th>URI</th><th>REPOSITORY</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Console</td><td>Console</td><td>1.0</td><td>Java</td><td>INT</td><td>http://your_hostname/docs/application/webadmin.html</td><td>/www/wdap/docroot/console</td><td>WebAdmin Console</td>
</tr>
</table>
where URI points to the documentation of the application, REPOSITORY is for
the OS path to the repository of the application.
<p>
Next, you need to add the application to the default site.  Expand <b>site</b>
on the navigation tree on the left pane and click on the site you are working
on.  The working pane shows an empty table since there is no application added
to the site.  Click on <b>add</b> button on the top and enter <b>Console</b>
into the popup box to add Console to the site.  On the working pane, click on
the name of newly added application.  It leads you to the configuration view
of the application.  Click on <b>Import</b> button on the top and enter
<tt>/www/wdap/examples/postgresql/WebAdmin</tt> to import WebAdmin service into
the repository.  The import process will create WebAdmin as a new service for
Console. Please select on <b>WebAdmin</b> and click on <b>Modify</b> button to
change its URI to <tt>http://your_hostname</tt>.  Click on <b>WebAdmin</b>
again or click on <b>Modify</b> button to save the change.  Since you have
made some changes to the files in <tt>/www/wdap/console</tt>, please make
sure to import the changes back to the DB.  Then, please make sure to publish
the WebAdmin service. Please switch to the deployment view and create the
instance of WebAdmin Console on the box.
</p>
<p>
As a Java web application, WebAdmin Console heavily relies on the database. In
case of the database outage, the WebAdmin Console will not work at all.
However, the design of WebAdmin ensures the system will still work in the
manual mode. During the database outage or webapps outage, the Console will not
be usable. But users can use command line tools to make changes directly to
the repository bypassing the database and staging. Once the changes are done,
they can be deployed to production via the command line tools also. The only
thing to remember is to import all the changes into the database once the
admin console is back up. Otherwise, the repository and the database will be
out of sync.
</p>
<p>
The command line deployment is to run <i>/www/wdap/bin/deploy.sh</i> as the
owner of the repository. The utility is required by both the synchronous
deployment and the asynchronous deployment. Some applications, like Agent,
supports the asynchronous deployment. If it is enabled, the asynchronous
deployment is good enough as long as the application is running. In fact, Agent
will check the repository for new updates every 5 min by default. If they
see the new timestamp, they will reload the configuration files automatically.
For other applications, like Flow or Console, the synchronous deployment is
required. Either way, you do not have to login on each of the boxes to do the
task again and again. The command line utility will save your time, especially
when you are dealing with clusters with multiple vms.
</p>
<p>
Here is the procedure to deploy changes asynchronously for Agent:
</p>
<ul>
<li> login on the WebAdmin box and switch to the owner of the repository. </li>
<li> go to <tt>/www/wdap/docroot/agent</tt> </li>
<li> determine which service to modify and cd to <tt>your_service/cfg</tt></li>
<li> modify/add/delete the json files for the monitors </li>
<li> update the master file of Agent.json </li>
<li> run the following command to update the service file:
<pre>
/www/wdap/bin/deploy.sh -a agent -c your_service
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
Since Agent is monitoring the service file in the repository, it will notice the
new timestamp of the file and downloads the file for the reload automatically.
<p>
Here is the procedure to deploy changes synchronously for Agent:
</p>
<ul>
<li> login on the WebAdmin box and switch to the owner of the repository. </li>
<li> go to <tt>/www/wdap/docroot/agent</tt> </li>
<li> determine which service to modify and cd to <tt>your_service/cfg</tt></li>
<li> make all necessary changes on the monitors.  </li>
<li> update the master file of Agent.json </li>
<li> run the following command to update the service file:
<pre>
/www/wdap/bin/deploy.sh -a agent -c your_service
</pre>
</li>
<li> run the following command to scp configuration files to the boxse:
<pre>
/www/wdap/bin/push.exp ../host.lst *.json /opt/qbroker/agent
</pre>
</li>
<li> run the following command to restart all instances of Agent:
<pre>
/www/wdap/bin/launch.exp ../host.lst /opt/qbroker/bin/agentctl restart
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
As you can see, it has two extra steps as compared to the asynchrous deployment.
The last 2 steps are to deploy the configurations to the boxes and then restart
the instances on them manually.
<p>
For other applications, you need to replace <b>-a agent</b> with the
<b>-a short_name</b> of the application. The directories should be also replaced
by the proper values.  Since the changes are made on the repository directly,
the versions in the DB and the staging area will be out of sync with those
of the repository.  Please do remember to import the changes back to the DB
once the DB is available again.
