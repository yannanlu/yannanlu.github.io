<p>
RequestNode picks up JMS messages as requests or their async responses from
the uplink and processes them according to their content and the pre-defined
rulesets. There are four fixed outlinks, done, bypass, failure, and nohit,
as well as the request outlink for collectiables. For a request message,
RequestNode routes it to the request outlink first. Once the message is
collected from the outlink, it will be cached with a unique key waiting for
the asynchonous reply. When a response message finally arrives, RequestNode
extracts the unique key from it and looks for the corresponding request
message from the cache. If the request message is found, RequestNode loads
the response to the request message and routes it to the outlink of done.
The response message will be routed to the outlink of bypass afterwards.
This is called that the request message has been claimed by its response.
If there is no corresponding request found for the response message, it will
be routed to the outlink of nohit. In case that a cached key has expired,
its request message will be flushed to the outlink of failure. Eventually,
all the claimed keys or expired keys will be removed from the cache. If an
incoming message is neither a request nor a response, RequestNode will treat
it as a bypass and routes it to one of the four fixed outlinks without any
delay. Since RequestNode does not consume any message, any incoming message
has to find a way out via one of the four fixed outlinks.

<p>
RequestNode contains a number of pre-defined rulesets.  These rulesets
categorize messages into non-overlapping groups.  Therefore, each rule
defines a unique message group.  The ruleset also defines the cache or claim
options for the messages in each group as well as the other parameters used
in the process. Furthermore, RequestNode always creates one extra ruleset,
nohit.  The ruleset of nohit is for all the messages not hitting any of
the filters.
</p>
<p>
You are free to choose any names for the first four fixed outlinks.  But
RequestNodee always assumes the first outlink for done, the second for
bypass, the third for failure and the fourth for nohit. The rest of the
outlinks are for collectibles. It is OK for those first four fixed outlinks
to share the same name. Please make sure the first fixed outlink has the
actual capacity no less than that of the uplink.

Apart from the common properties, there are some implementation specific
properties for RequestNode.

The request operation is executed via the pre-defined rulesets. Therefore,
the configuration of the rulesets is critical to the operations of RequestNode.
Here are complete properties of rulesets for RequestNode.

</TABLE>
where KeyTemplate is to build the unique key for cache or for responses.
RuleType specifies the rule is for responses only.  PreferredOutLink specifies
the outlink for the requests. If it is one of the fixed outlinks (final exits),
the ruleset is a bypass. Here is an example of the bypass ruleset.
<pre>
{
  ..
  "Ruleset": [{
    "Name": "bypass",
    "PreferredOutLink": "done",
    "JMSPropertyGroup": [{
      "JMSType": "^score$"
    }]
  }],
  ...
}
</pre>
where it sends the messages to the outlink of done without processing them.
